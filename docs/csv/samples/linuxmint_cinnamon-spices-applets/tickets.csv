Also, if I load the  gputemperature@silentage.com applet, it only displays the same GPU temperature values on both Arch and Manjaro.  I do not leave this applet running as it displays a  _not compatible warning_  on loading and crashes Cinnamon from time to time.  I posted the issue several days ago, but have had no response from @silentage.com. My priority would be to get the GPU temperature running rather than the CPU, because I never overclock and have not had any CPU overheating issues. ",COMMENT

Yesterday I downloaded Spices Update applet using the steps I described when the [pull request](https://github.com/linuxmint/cinnamon-spices-applets/pull/2482) was opened. Today the pull request is merged into master. Then I download the applet again with `Download` button I get cached version. `metadata.json` file still has `&quot;version&quot;: &quot;2.0.0&quot;` in it. The same happens when I installed the applet today through `Applets` system app. Can you reproduce the above steps with the website for an opened pull request ?,COMMENT

No, it isn't intentional. What happens is that the applet code hasn't been updated (its functional parts at least) in more than three years.

Your problem could be that the applet doesn't handle orientation changes (moving the applet from the top to the bottom). Try restarting Cinnamon after you place the applet in the bottom panel.

Could you please try to close the programs in your systray one after another and try to find out if a specific program causes those error messages?  Another approach would be to save your collapsible-systray config, uninstall and reinstall it and set up everything again.  If you tried both steps or already tried them on your own, we need to dig depper. Also keep in mind collapsible-systray isn't actively developed for quite some time.

You could look at the Feeds Reader applet for [how does it calls a Python script](https://github.com/linuxmint/cinnamon-spices-applets/blob/master/feeds%40jonbrettdev.wordpress.com/files/feeds%40jonbrettdev.wordpress.com/feedreader.js#L134) to get [the return data](https://github.com/linuxmint/cinnamon-spices-applets/blob/master/feeds%40jonbrettdev.wordpress.com/files/feeds%40jonbrettdev.wordpress.com/getFeed.py#L96).  It basically does this:  ```javascript Util.spawn_async([&quot;python-script.py&quot;, &quot;arg1&quot;, &quot;arg2&quot;], (aStdout) =&gt; {     let data = aStdout; }); ```  Even Cinnamon does it this way to open a Save/Open file dialog from JavaScript code (the [fileDialog.js](https://github.com/linuxmint/Cinnamon/blob/master/js/misc/fileDialog.js) module uses the [cinnamon-file-dialog Python script](https://github.com/linuxmint/Cinnamon/blob/master/files/usr/bin/cinnamon-file-dialog)).  For my own fork of the weather applet, I looked into the BBC Weather feeds to see if it would be worth it to include a dependency to `feedparser` (the Python module that the Feeds Reader applet uses). But I dimmed it not worthy at all (look at their [Forecast response](https://weather-broker-cdn.api.bbci.co.uk/en/forecast/rss/3day/2643123) and [Current weather response](https://weather-broker-cdn.api.bbci.co.uk/en/observation/rss/2643123)).",COMMENT

Merging 'Favorite' into application categories is too far away from this purpose.  The Windows 7 Menu always opens with the 'Favorites' window. The MATE Menu opens with 'Favorites' menu as well, but it remembers if it has been closed with 'Favorites' or 'All programs' window. That's what CinnVIIStarkMenu does as well. You can try this by choosing the &quot;MATE-Menu&quot; layout in the settings.  What can be done is to add an option to have 'All Programs' opened by default (as you suggested). Since I'm very busy lately I can't add this right now. But I can target this for Mint 19.2, i.e. May/June.",COMMENT

It is automatically set up for interfaces present when it is installed by Mint. That will not have occurred for VPNs. It is an old program and the addition of interfaces is not trivial, I have done it for Bluetooth and mobile internet dongles. It is documented and `man vnstat` should provide information but will need some experimenting even if it is possible.  The applet only detects interfaces which are managed by the Network Manager and I would not expect two to show up, in fact I have difficulty seeing how that can happen in a single cycle.   You may want to try my other applet the Network Usage Monitor with alerts as that shows what has been detected and is active using similar code.   I currently do not have access to Linux machine where I can test but I can see you have done a lot of coding so the essential thing is to get vnstat creating a database after which you can fix the device to get vnstati to display the correct interface.",COMMENT

I did consider making either a small GUI to edit these, something in Python/TKinter, and then thought about having some kind of central repository of sheets where you can add/edit without having to add the sheet to this repo every time. Requires some hosting/building which leads to a Cinnamon applet dependent on a third party service.  I'll have a dig around for a YAML solution. I think it is better.

Best guess is that it had to be related to the hardware. Which in turn would keep readjusting the redshift slider and not remembering the value I had set it to.

Was a first time install, downloaded and installed from the applets dialog. It started the install then just hung. Tried everything to get control,  but nothing on the keyboard worked, alt F2, nothing. Except; ctrl/alt/f1 to f6 still worked giving me a new session also  ctrl/alt/backspace worked taking me back to the login screen.  Logging in opened a bank black screen and the only thing that did  anything was moving the mouse cursor  but nothing there to click on. I was starting to think it was malicious because in a repair session I  deleted the app directory  2 or 3 times, &quot;.cinnamon/configs/...&quot; and it  kept reappearing! Ha, was reminding me of my windows days 20 years ago.   Anyway,  eventually gave up and went for supper.  Came back rebooted a few more  times.  On reboots login always appeared and noticed the login wallpaper was  changing, that's from Variety, so figured something must still be running. Logged in again and left it sit for 1/2 an hour upon returning blessings  of all blessings my desktop was there and your icon was on the panel. But stupid me, clicked it and the problem started all over again. Followed the same steps and got back to a visible panel and right  clicked to get the  applets dialog and deleted the app. It took around 10 to 20 minutes to delete, probably because it was  looking for the app directory which did delete the last time I tried.

Numix Curry, Green &amp; Red weren't and aren't, because they are my forks of the original. I removed transparency, some lines and shadows as well as some other fancy things, and gave them new highlight colours: Curry, Green, and Red. What I did not do is move any file from any folder to any other folder, so all three are still in the original state - except for the changes within the css files.  The puzzling thing is that the combination of a forked Numix theme and Spices Update worked perfectly well for nearly one year - until last week when there was an update of Spices Update itself. ;-) What's more: Changing the theme to different default themes did not make Spices Update work either.  Hence the question: Who loads an applet, desklet or extension? No matter which theme or the OS itself? I'm inclined to say that it's the OS itself, most of all because .xsession-errors said: Applet SpicesUpdate@claudiux: Could not create applet object. and: Error importing applet.js from SpicesUpdate@claudiux.

I haven taken a while to comment as I wanted to try it out for a little while and to get my thoughts together.  @100kI am impressed - there are a number of interesting ideas and you have made some additions to the context menu that i did not realise were possible, although there are still a few anomalies which would need sorting out.  I do however have a number of concerns with some of the concept. The original applet was deigned to have a very low footprint on the toolbar so it could always be present and to be very simple and quick to activate as a timer during expense critical activities such as phone calls, time chargeable internet access etc. I therefore kept the count to minutes and seconds only with an indicator that it had over-run so the tooltip could be checked. I resisted adding many 'Bells and Whistles'  quite deliberately. This was made clear in the Rationale statement.  It was also made clear in the header that It was also intended to not only useful in its own right but is also provides a 'tutorial' framework for other more complex applets - for example it provides a settings screen and a 'standard' right click (context) menu which opens the settings panel and a Housekeeping submenu accessing help and a version/update files and also the gnome system monitor program in case you want to find out how much machine power this applet is using at various update rates. It also provides an example of how to implement l10n localisation/translation support.  So I would like to include some of the additions you have put forwards for the context menu when the anomalies have been removed but have concerns over changing the panel display to occupy addition space unless it is available as an option.  I currently do not understand the rationale for the ability to change the timer 'on the fly' unless it is intended as a substitute for a timer which brings me to another point - I do not thing there is currently a good combined timer, stopwatch clock applet giving the functionality we have come to expect in mobile devices running android etc.  I would appreciate your and perhaps @brownsr 's comments on whether  a useful way ahead would be for you to 'fork' my applet with your Features into  a new stand alone applet which could in the longer term provide not only a stopwatch but also a timer to which alerts etc could be added and perhaps even offer some clock functions such as alarm clock and global times.  In the meantime I have seen some anomalies in the modification of the title in the context menu where changes initially displayed incorrectly - sometimes a cinnamon restart then displayed the correct text but not every time.

In any case I am working on integrating most of your modifications either in the baseline or as an option.   The first phase would be changes to the context menu to give access to title and make a single line for the various start pause and resume options. However I still see anomalies in when title changes are applied even with an extra update u call.  The next phase will be to add Option of size of panel display on a instance by instance basis.  That only leaves your timer modifications which I do not expect many people to use in its existing form but could be an Experimental Option.

Cinnamon only uses .po files found inside a folder called **po** at the root of the xlet folder and those .po files are automatically installed/uninstalled every time that an xlet is installed/uninstalled.  I think that what you should do is just add the **it.po** file inside a folder called **po** in the `WindowListGroup@jake.phy@gmail.com` applet so at least the Italian translation is functional in this applet. Its structure can be fixed in a different PR (that is, moving all the other .po files and the .pot file inside the **po** folder).",COMMENT

It seems a little incongruous that this applet, which is supposed to make it _more_ convenient to update spices, now nags me nearly every day to update itself.

Maybe it's different for users with dozens of spices installed, the likelihood of an update being needed every day would certainly increase, but for most of us, we see a spice update maybe once in a week or two. Updates to this spice should not be so frequent that 90% of the time this is the only spice to be updated !",COMMENT

The only point in an audible alert is to attract attention when one is away from the machine otherwise the modal alert stops you doing anything. It has to be a sound that is loud, long and attention grabbing. The one I use personally is a sound file I found for which is used somewhere for emergency evacuation of a building which cuts through most background and the effect in a quiet library, workplace or train at full volume could cause some concern. This is actually discussed in help file.  What I am considering is putting an additional checkbox in the settings to inhibit this notification for those who do not need it the next time I do an update.  In the meantime if you really have a real problem with this you could comment out the line in `.local/share/cinnamon/applets/batterymonitor@pdcurtis/3.2/applet.js` at about  line 171 starting `Main.warningNotify`  Can you also please close this as an issue or change it to a [Feature Request]",COMMENT

I have a couple of suggestions for you.  You have hard-coded the configuration file to be inside the applet folder. This will cause the configuration file to be overwritten every time the applet is updated by the user, loosing all configurations. You can simply implement the Cinnamon's settings system on your applet. You can read the documentation about how to implement it (see at the end).  And here comes the nightmare part (LOL). You are using a terminal extracted from a setting. But you are using CLI parameters that are used very differently by different terminals.  - The `-t` (or `--title`) parameter in **Gnome Terminal**, depending on the distribution and the version of **Gnome Terminal**, may not exist at all because it was removed at some point upstream and added back by some forks. - The `-t` parameter in **Xterm** means a totally different thing. - In **Terminator** is used the `-T` parameter (uppercase). - In **Tilda** the `-t` parameter is used to set transparency.  The point is, you can't rely on the `-t` parameter to set the title of a random terminal. There is a somewhat universal way to set a terminal title *on-the-fly*; by executing the command `echo -ne &quot;\033]0;SOME TITLE HERE\007&quot;`.  And the nightmare continues. The `-e` parameter is also problematic because in **Gnome Terminal** the `-e` parameter was removed (around 3.32 I think).  And lastly, you can avoid all function bindings (the use of `.bind(this)`) by simply using arrow functions. This isn't an issue at all, I'm just informing you that you could (not all JavaScript changes are useless syntactic sugar after all (LOL)).  ### Documentation  For an updated documentation, install the packages `devhelp` and `cinnamon-doc`. Then open Devhelp from your applications menu. It not only contains a more up-to-date documentation that the one on-line, but also has documentations about the **St** library and Cinnamon's JavaScrit modules.  For documentation about GObject libraries (Clutter, GLib, Gio, etc.), exists [this on-line documentation](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/) that can also be [downloaded for off-line use](https://github.com/lazka/pgi-docs) as a static HTML site, and also can be downloaded as [Devhelp books](https://github.com/pygobject/pgi-docs-devhelp).",COMMENT

For example:  ```json &quot;cinnamon-version&quot;: [     &quot;3.8&quot;,     &quot;4.0&quot;,     &quot;4.2&quot; ] ```  And the installation and activation of the applet on a non listed Cinnamon version is not blocked; a warning message is displayed instead:  &gt; Extension &lt;UUID&gt; is not compatible with current version of cinnamon. Using it may break your system. Load anyway?  ***  &gt; I will consider a better icon.

I am not really sure if my aim or my idea is way easier than googling and it is really hard to explain, but in my personal experience if I want to look for particular words; let's say &quot;movie&quot;, &quot;alone&quot;, &quot;uncle&quot;; on Google (if I keep going with the examples) I will type something like &quot;word movie in ASL&quot;, but instead of getting the word and the &quot;translation&quot; or the page; I will get results of movies that explain what is ASL. All of the above is why I am creating the applet, so I can centralize the effort and make things easier for any user and/or at least those who are learning or want to learn ASL (myself included)  (This may be irrelevant to the PR but I wanted to say this) Now, there might be some problems and I can cite some of them:  * Not many sites would like to provide their information for free (the one I am putting at least is fine while I cite them as reference), if the website (or the many websites) doesn't want to do this I have to find a way in the future that doesn't break the behaviour of the applet * It is hard to take a particular sign movement as standard since, for example, my mentor sometimes does words with variations that, until now, I have been unable to understand why it is different from the ones on the internet * As a particular situation on my country (and something that my mentor blames also) is that because people wouldn't understand the &quot;English&quot; on the ASL, they decided to initialize many signs and not many people understand the &quot;pure ASL&quot; so we have a mixture on those * This is not a problem itself, but I noticed (and my mentor told me after I asked), that not many people outside of non-technical careers are interested in learning ASL, however, we all use any OS (Android, Linux, Mac, Windows) and it would be great to show exactly a technological way (if I can say it that way) of learning sign language  **EDIT:** rephrased a little bit my idea and now I talked with the persons (once again, a little bit irrelevant to the PR and the code but I also wanted to express it anyway), they are not willing to help me at full time (at least with consulting) since they fully commit to teach ASL and another sign language and I can't pay for their time (be it monetarily or any other way) but will be watching any progress from my side and if I &quot;teach&quot; the signs as intended since they want people to spread the word about sign language and to make people understand why it is important, besides they barely have any time off (neither of them are technical either, so any technological effort from any side it is very welcome as long as the teaching can be done perfectly out of respect to all deaf people  Hope this can help you and if you need something else from me please let me know, also I will try to keep reading documentation (which so far I have been between googling, the information of mint-doc + devhelp package, the current developer site and &quot;reverse engineering&quot; the behaviour of other applets as well) and request some help from you or someone else, so we can work this out.

Disclaimer: I am no JS developer at all, so please don't be to hard if I misinterpret some things.  Another thing which is interesting too, is the question how to check if `fill` is implemented in Cinnamon or in Debian.",COMMENT

So it can probably be removed, like you suggested:    this.datas = Array(this.width);  It is weird though, that you get this error but I am not, and obviously most people are not. What version of Cinnamon are you running? You can check this by running:    cinnamon --version  in a terminal  I am currently working on implementing a mode for vertical panels, but after that I will look at fixing this.",COMMENT

Many applets do contain checks if the Cinnamon version is at 3.2, and then do things differently. I have not looked in to what they do differently though, but fill() could be on thing that was added in 3.2, I guess!? And maybe it doesn't work 100% in the early 3.2-versions? I am just guessing here though...  I think you can close this issue now, and if it occurs again, please do open a new issue.

The solution is to store the previous value of delta and to restore it when delta becomes lesser than -50000.  ``` CpuDataProvider.prototype = {      _init: function(){         this.gtop = new GTop.glibtop_cpu();         this.current = 0;         this.last = 0;         this.usage = 0;         this.last_total = 0;         this.last_delta = 0;         this.name = _(&quot;CPU&quot;);         this.type = &quot;CPU&quot;;     },      getData: function() {         GTop.glibtop_get_cpu(this.gtop);          this.current = this.gtop.idle;          let delta = this.gtop.total - this.last_total;         //global.log(&quot;Moniteur: delta &quot; + delta );         if (delta &lt; -50000) {             delta = this.last_delta;         }         if (delta &gt; 0) {             this.usage = (this.current - this.last) / delta;             this.last = this.current;             this.last_total = this.gtop.total;             this.last_delta = delta;         }          return 1 - this.usage;     } }; ```  I will make a PR.",COMMENT

What is the reasoning for changing default values and screenshot? The proposed default values only change the applet padding and whether the border is drawn, which I consider subjective if a user likes this more than the current default values and if not, they can always change it in the settings. Custom padding also overrides the default Cinnamon applet padding, which I believe should not be overridden by default. The proposed screenshot shows a horizontal applet with proposed default settings, but the current screenshot shows both horizontal and vertical applet while the vertical is being drawn with borders, therefore I think it is more representative of the applet.  You can create pull requests for translations alone without applet owners agreeing, so if you want, you can either close this and create a new pull request for the translation or revert changes to default values and screenshot in this pull request and then I will agree to it.",COMMENT

Issues do not automatically get to the author, a poor feature of Github.  Extra instances can be added from the Applets in the Control Centre (The + at the bottom of Manage Tab). The latest versions of Cinnamon do not offer adding and removing within Configure dialogue from the right click menu.   So what you are seeing is the expected behaviour and is Not an issue - it is a Feature of the new versions of Cinnamon. You reach the different instances from the arrows at the top. I agree that it is not such a convenient display but there is nothing I can do so can you please close the issue.  I however need to update the image in the description and will do so at my next update.  I am not sure why you got an error message, I have not been able to replicate it under any version of Cinnamon including 4.2 and there have been no other reports. Have you seen it again?

There was [a bug](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gjs/commit/19e899cd5008c2a00785769dc0ba2564d8447fe1) a few years ago in Gnome Shell, where used memory would grow with use. It was caused by SpiderMonkey's GC not freeing cairo contexts (and associated cairo surfaces) after dispose(), and I use cairo for drawing in my applet. To fix the issue, the function $dispose() was added to GJS (and thus CJS) to explicitly dispose of cairo surfaces.  I've installed Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS with Cinnamon to a VM and was able to reproduce the issue. Exactly as you say, each repaint increased memory usage and it was worse with faster refresh rate and/or larger applet area. I now manually dispose of cairo context after each repaint, let it run over night (at least 10 hours) with an applet as large as 1 panel and used memory by Cinnamon was still at 250 MB, more or less the same as after reboot.  Could you test if the changes work for you as well (and this was indeed the same issue you have) before I make a pull request?

If it really comes from that, not sure what to do to avoid both increased RAM and CPU usage. If I understand the problem right, GC won't collect cairo surfaces, I have to explicitly call $dispose() every time I use cairo context, so I can't call it with lower frequency. Maybe I could use only 1 drawing area for the whole applet. Right now, each graph uses its own drawing area, because it simplifies the code for drawing and enabling / disabling specific graphs.

It was 10:30 before it showed the 9 am temp. Now in the afternoon the temp is more stable and not changing as rapidly. But late morning I changed from 15 minute interval to 5 minute and it is doing much better. But that change should not have mattered. Probably because the temp is now more stable it seems more accurate. But also if most of my update request were being rejected it would seem slower to update. By changing to 5 minutes I am making 3x as many request so that might be it.  Not sure to tell if my request are being rejected.  But since no one else has a concern it must be me.

There's also an option to scrape websites for temp/weather forecast data.  Some alternatives that we could use to replace Yahoo:    - https://darksky.net/dev - 1000 calls per day for free, requires an API key &amp; registration.   - https://openweathermap.org/price - don't let that word 'open' and '.org' fool you.. you still need an API key and you get a 5 day forecast   - https://www.apixu.com/ - need an API key + registration; limited number of requests   - https://www.foreca.com/ - I found this after I snooped on Windows 10's weather app in a VM. It's using this service. It's actually one of the most comprehensive weather solutions (i.e. https://www.foreca.com/United_States/California/Oakland ) but I don't see an API so scarping would be the only solution... but as a benefit, you wouldn't need to register.    - http://wttr.in/ - weather on a command line: `curl http://wttr.in/oakland` would have to be scraped; no idea about the source of the data.

The reason is that, as a 3rd party applet, we could potentially have multiple versions of the applet with multiple versions of Cinnamon, and so if we change something about the way applets are installed, etc (this does happen from time to time), it could potentially break something for the user which wouldn't be fixed by removing the applet.  Also, as @jaszhix mentioned, that script is not intended to be used by anyone but applet (et al) developers who wish to test their code without actually pushing their changes and waiting for it to be merged.  I would much rather see a stock Cinnamon applet, which uses Spices.py directly for all spices stuff. Such an applet would ideally do all the heavy lifting in python (where we already have all the necessary functions in one place), and then communicate status, commands, and notifications via dbus. This will be much easier to maintain, and also ensure that the version that users have always matches their version of Cinnamon. Plus it will help cut down on spurious and hard to track bug reports that might arise.",COMMENT

The two applets have diverged a lot.  It wouldn't be impossible to back-port the bug fixes, and refinements - but I would rather help maintain one window list applet, and patch the things people are missing in ITM for Cinnamon 4.2.

Currently I have 13 different programs running some with up to 4 instances and the ITM makes it very easy.   Overall it looks as if quite a few options were dropped.   Also the icons seem to be much smaller and have odd bars on the bottom on several themes and no indication which window is in focus. It may be I am running with an early copy.

That does not seem to be what the only actual  documentation I could find at http://developer.linuxmint.com/reference/git/cinnamon-tutorials/xlet-versioning.html says about where earlier versions should live. To quote:  &gt; To enable extension versioning, extensions have to add the line &gt;  &gt; { &gt;       &quot;multiversion&quot;: true &gt; } &gt;  &gt; in metadata.json. The different versions should be put in different subdirectories. For example, the version for 2.6 should be put in `extension@uuid/2.6/`. The contents in 2.6/ should be exactly what you will normally put in `extension@uuid/`, apart from metadata.json, which should always be put in the parent directory, ie. `extension@uuid/`. &gt;  &gt; You do not need to create a subdirectory for every single Cinnamon version out there. Cinnamon looks for the most recent subdirectory that is not newer than the running Cinnamon version. For example, if you are running 2.6 and there are 2.4, 2.8 directories, the 2.4 directory will be loaded, until the you upgrade to 2.8 in which case the 2.8 directory will be used. Minor version numbers can also be used, eg. 2.6.4, and are sorted accordingly. &gt;  &gt; If no suitable directory is found, then the contents in `extension@uuid/` will be loaded. Note that Cinnamon versions prior to 2.6 will not understand this directory magic, and will always try to load the contents in `extension@uuid/`. **Hence it is suggested that extension maintainers put the version for 2.4 in extension@uuid, and create new directories if changes specific to newer Cinnamon versions are made.** Don&rsquo;t make a new directory whenever a Cinnamon version is out since it is just a waste of space (and maintenance effort). &gt;   I also looked at several other applets before I started. The system seems to be very tolerant and one only seemed to have the changed files in the x.y folder but most seemed to follow the above. Your applets however work with nothing in `extension@uuid/`  The applets also work fine on my Mint 19 system so Cinnamon is not ignoring them with `multiversion`  enabled in metadata.json and are supported back to 2.2 which came with LTS version 17 which is current until some time in 2019.  Do you have some more up to date documentation that I have not found?",COMMENT

You can specify the cinnamon version if you want to, you don't really need to if you have the versions taken care of with directories.

I have run tests:  1.  to make sure that `cinnamon-version` does prevent loading of applets and shows it in error log in Looking Glass.  2. to make sure that  applets load from default position of  `extension@uuid/` as well as from folders  I am assuming one should cover back to LTS 17.x for the next 6 months (until 19.2) although users numbers of 17.x are likely to be small.  Some conclusions are:  - If support does not extend back over the currently supported  LTSs then `cinnamon-version` is essential regardless of whether `multiversion` is in use.  - One should currently use `cinnamon-version` to provide the first version supported or one should have the contents in `extension@uuid/` as there is no mechanism to support `multiversion` until cinnamon 2.6. Examples of the contents in `extension@uuid/` from better known players include `sticky@scollins` and `searchbox@mtwebster`.  - Once LTS 17 has dropped out of support at 19.2 and if `multiversion` is needed then having a 2.6 folder and nothing in `extension@uuid/` will be preferable and more clear.    - Likewise use of `cinnamon-version` when `multiversion` is in use is good practice (although it currently does not seem to be essential).   - If the use of `cinnamon-version` increases then there are advantages in keeping it to a single line so a find and replace can be used to automatically update all the applets as cinnamon versions increment.  So my current plan is to:  -  Add a  `cinnamon-version` to the applets here via an extra commit and leave the code in  in `extension@uuid/`  When Mint 19.2/Cinnamon 4.2 becomes available  - Move the code for early versions from to a 2.6 folder from `extension@uuid/`     ",COMMENT

Allowing any click on a note to raise them would be great, since it is really annoying to go searching for the 0.5cm applet icon, when there is a large piece of note visible. Fixing unraising in edit mode would be good, too.  Short of rewriting the applet to use actual windows for the notes, it would be great if the notes could behave as a window as a whole: all the notes stay together, but when another window is raised above them, the notes do not fall behind /all/ windows but just the focused one (and any later focused windows): the notes' canvas has a position in the stack of windows.

I agree there is a void in the Linux space for something like CPU-Z, but it shouldn't be running inside Cinnamon. Its just supposed to be a part of the panel, and there is a limit to how much data an applet can show for practical reasons.

I have seen a similar problem returning from suspend on a different applet which cleared with a cinnamon reset. It came sometime after I installed Mint 19 but it went away with one of the recent cinnamon updates on my machine so I hope it was a Cinnamon issue. I am watching for it. I also have a couple of minor updates in the pipeline to improve compatibility with systems other than Mint so I will update the version log when I put the next PR in.,COMMENT

The applet also has a red border when discharging which should be be clear to most people with a yellow/green deficiency. The only other way to be sure is to not use colours at all as is the case with much of the Mint standard themes and applets but I find a bright colour 'traffic light' is much more effective for applets where there are 'warnings' etc which need to be heeded.  Yours is however a useful point and one I will keep in mind in any major updates or new applets.

You never know though, which is why I left it open for a while. Basically, I'm trying to clean up a little bit. Most of these have been abandoned since before we moved everything to github (over a year and a half ago). Some of them haven't had a developer in several years. Combine that with the fact that they all have zero ratings and that seems like enough reason to remove them. If they had a developer or people actually showed interest, I'd leave them.  If there are any that you would like to maintain, you're welcome to, but there are a lot of more popular applets that don't currently have a maintainer, and I'd much rather focus on those. I'd much rather have a smaller number of really good ones that people can easily choose from, than a much larger number of mediocre, half-functioning, or completely broken applets that users have to wade through to find anything good. (Most of them will just give up after a little bit of wading and assume that it's all junk.)",COMMENT

If a dialog box pops up and asks you to update/refresh, say yes. If you do not get asked to refresh click the refresh button (circular arrows) at bottom of window. After refresh, locate Workspace Grid applet in the list and click the Update button (single circular arrow). The button will change to a check mark when the update is complete.

I don't know how shortcuts in applets works, but it looks like pressed keys aren't filtered by the shortcut mechanism.  May be it's not significative, but before updating the applet, when I updated cinnamon and saw that this shortcuts wasn't working anymore, I unattributed in the cinnamon shortcut setting panel the corresponding shortcuts. I will search how to reinitialize those configurations. ",COMMENT

Maybe setting the search box `height` to `auto` and the `line-height` to for instance `1.25` would fix the problem.

There are several problems clashing in here. Follow the bellow steps to make the applet work.  1. Completely remove the applet and re-install it from Cinnamon's applets manager (do not edit anything from the applet's code). 2. Install the settings schema with the following command (It will ask for password): `pkexec cinnamon-schema-install /full/path/to/schemas/org.cinnamon.hamster-applet.gschema.xml` 3. And lastly, set execution permissions to the **prefs.js** file (located inside the xlet folder). 4. Now place it in any panel and it should work immediately.  **Edit:** I forgot to mention that I did these tests on Ubuntu 18.04 Beta2 and Linux Mint 18.3 and both systems with Cinnamon version 3.6.7. I didn't test on Archlinux. I also tested with the hamster-applet package installed and all seems to work fine.  ### Problems with xlets installation process  @collinss (?)  1. Schema files found inside sub-folders are ignored (not installed when an xlet is installed). 2. Xlet's file permissions aren't retained. If I [download the applet](https://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com/applets/view/140) mentioned in this issue from its Spices page and extract it, the **prefs.js** file has execution permissions. But the downloaded (and ultimately installed) package from the applets manager has all permissions changed. ",COMMENT

Cinnamon files (e.g. imports.ui/misc/perf) and GObject introspection bindings (imports.gi.*) don't need any changes. The file loader for xlets needed to be changed because we removed the [sub-importer patch](https://github.com/linuxmint/Cinnamon/pull/6790) and some others that made it diverge from GJS for easier maintainability (the mozjs52 rebase would have broke them).   Reverting to the vanilla GJS importer results in applets not being able to be reloaded - as has been the case in Cinnamon 3.6 - which is useful for updating applets, and live-reloading during development, so the [new importer](https://github.com/linuxmint/Cinnamon/commit/f01bd803d5ae8978d934e1a84d07222e6ec866c4) works around it entirely by handling file I/O in Cinnamon instead.   There was [one PR](https://github.com/linuxmint/Cinnamon/pull/7349) I thought would be merged, but decided to pull it because it had its own set of regressions. Unfortunately I was testing using it, which is not compatible with what's in master now, so I have been revisiting some of my initial fixes for 3.8. ",COMMENT

I was assuming the new NM typelib was a new library since it has different namespaces - I'm guessing there isn't a way to load the old typelib on the same system.

The `DataProviders.js` uses `GLib.spawn_sync` to get this value and then acts accordingly. This works mostly great.  On the Mint system (in a VirtualBox) it takes 30-60 ms for the plugin to start which seems fast enough (seeing that the entire AppletManager takes ~500ms). However on my Fedora system (run on bare-metal) it takes a whopping 700 ms to start (out of 1144 ms which means that all the other plugins are starting faster while this one is significantly slower). My guess is that this is because it is running as a bash script which is then sourcing my `.bashrc` file which takes some time to run.

According to Cinnamon 3.6.7 changelog (https://github.com/linuxmint/Cinnamon/blob/master/debian/changelog) the function signature was changed for St.Clipboard.get_text to support different types of clipboard. A simple patch is needed on the indicated line in applet.js to add St.ClipboardType.CLIPBOARD as first argument of clipboard.get_text in on_applet_clicked event sink. This will of course break compatibility to previous cinnamon versions so I'm looking forward to a smarter implementation from the main developer.,COMMENT

I have never programmed an applet and have very little experience with such coding languages, so I may be utterly mistaken in my understanding of the code.  So take my input for what it is worth.  Looking at the file DataProviders.js I see a function GetDiskDevices which, if I am correctly reading the code, is to return a list of all mounted disk devices.  If this is indeed the case, it is not working as designed on my system.  The root system is hard coded in this function, as of course it is always mounted.  But as you can see from my fstab in an earlier comment I also have two other disk devices mounted, /perm and /rosa, that are not being returned.

Cinnamon will run with the latest version folder in the applet directory, so a `3.4` folder should work. Icing Task Manager works the same way, Cinnamon serves 3.2, 3.4, and 3.6 users from files in the 3.2 directory. I re-tested installing this applet with a clean installation a couple times today.   Do you have `gir1.2-gtop-2.0` installed? What other applets are you running? Check with `gsettings get org.cinnamon enabled-applets`.  I'm reproducing the issue with opening Preferences. Its kind of weird:  ``` (cinnamon:3095): Cjs-WARNING **: JS ERROR: Exception in callback for signal: activate: GLib.SpawnError: Failed to execute child process &quot;prefs.js&quot; (Permission denied) ProcessSpawnHandler.prototype._init@/home/jason/.local/share/cinnamon/applets/multicore-sys-monitor@ccadeptic23/3.4/SpawnProcess.js:15:49 ProcessSpawnHandler@/home/jason/.local/share/cinnamon/applets/multicore-sys-monitor@ccadeptic23/3.4/SpawnProcess.js:8:3 anonymous/MyApplet.prototype.launchPreferences@/home/jason/.local/share/cinnamon/applets/multicore-sys-monitor@ccadeptic23/3.4/applet.js:226:34 _emit@resource:///org/cinnamon/cjs/modules/signals.js:142:27 PopupBaseMenuItem.prototype.activate@/usr/share/cinnamon/js/ui/popupMenu.js:178:9 PopupBaseMenuItem.prototype._onButtonReleaseEvent@/usr/share/cinnamon/js/ui/popupMenu.js:151:9 ```  When I check the permissions on the file:  ``` drwxrwxr-x  2 jason jason 4096 Oct 31 09:50 . drwxr-xr-x 64 jason jason 4096 Oct 31 09:50 .. -rw-rw-rw-  1 jason jason 6356 Oct 31 09:50 prefs.json ```  I'll see what I can find.

It looks the same with the default Cinnamon menu. Second: It's not the problem of a menu to deal with themeing. Colors are handled by the theme. Thus it should be fixed by the theme. Third: The categories are greyed out during the search to indicate, that you can't click those buttons during the search.   If you think it's unreadable, you probably should get in touch with the creator of the theme. The [Carta theme](https://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com/themes/view/Carta) is maintained by [andr35](https://github.com/andr35).  If you want to change the theme on your own (I think you searched for something like `search`), since those are the category buttons, which are greyed out, you can change those by changing the `cinnamon.css` theme, namely the lines: ``` .menu-category-button-greyed {     color: rgba(250, 0, 0, 0.45); } ``` The changes you make will only apply after restarting Cinnamon (CTRL+ALT+ESC).  But remember, that your changes will be overwritten, if you update the theme.",COMMENT

I wasn't sure if it was the applet or my desktop theme that might have been getting in the way. I started wondering if my eyes were going bad, I already wear glasses as it is... haha  But I do appreciate your time with this, that css line mod did solve it all for me. I was digging in wrong place in the css, Trying to use gcolor2 to copy in the css color codes to see if I could stumble across which was responsible for it, but still it was a fun time killer anyhow when I didn't have anything to do really.  And yea when I was using 'nano' to dig and search css (extremely old habit, as back after getting cs degree, and a couple certs, I'd always be found on our campus library system doing email in pine and editing files lazily in pico lol).  But you are spot on, I was searching for &quot;search&quot; in the code and trying to locate the rgb values there.   I'll add a little memo to self when updating themes where/what to modify in future after reading any latest updates here.   Again thank you for your time. Recently I rebuilt one of my old pcs in closet and maxed out the cpu on it, threw a ssd in it and my old gaming 9800 card from years ago, primarily used as my home &quot;cloud&quot; with 5 internal 'WD blue' drives and 3 external drives; 2 usb &amp; 1 esata. And gave Linux Mint a try and I really  enjoy it, super light, I absolutely loved that menu applet instead of stock. I've been a Slackware guy since late 90's around the 2.0.25 kernel, but Mint is one of the perfect distros for adding a ton of new life to an aging machine.  So thank you everyone, I greatly appreciate it and hope you all have a good weekend!   ",COMMENT

I few other notable improvements:  - Display on a vertical panel. - Moved the settings to the configuration panel - Changed the audio to use the full path like other applets - Clearing the timer will remove the notification - Clicking the window prompt will clear the alarm.,COMMENT

I installed sysstat and this applet. It shows always 0% for me. Also it doesn't pop up to show my two hard drives.  So I think it's not a Debian or Cinnamon 3.2 specific issue.  To clearify a little bit. The applets on the Cinnamon spices website are 3rd party applets. This means they are created by guys, which do not belong to the Linux Mint Team. Since all the applets from the old website have been migrated to this repo for the new website, a lot of broken and abandoned applets have been migrated as well. Some guys of the Linux Mint team have reviewed, fixed and deleted a lot of those applets. And they try to help where they can.  The author/developer of this applet has abandoned it. Some applets are easy to fix and others are difficult, especially if you are not familiar with the code. Since the guy, who is most familiar with the code, namely the author, has abandoned it, this won't be easy to fix.  If you're lucky, somebody who has time and skills sees this and might fix it or wants to maintain it. This can take some time.  The issue has been reported on the spices website 3 weeks ago. Bugs should be reported best here on GitHub. Unfortunatelly we don't get any notifications, when somebody makes a comment or reports a bug in a comment on the spices website. And nobodys clicking through hundreds of applets pages to see, if somebody wrote a new comment somewhere. So an issue is seen on GitHub faster. We know about this issue and try to improve it in the future.  That said I took a quick look at the logs and I don't see anything related to this applet. So I'm not sure what causes it. And right now I don't have much time to spare to look any further into this.",COMMENT

Now, the reason it doesn't work in Debian is because iostat doesn't return the same data there than in other distros. I can see in your Arch pastebin that it returns 13 values... the 13th being the percentage usage. Same thing in Mint. But looking at your pastebin in Debian I see 15 values instead...   The code is designed to run iostat -dxh 1 2 and to gather the 13th value... so if that value isn't there but in 15th position instead, it won't work.  So the applet needs to be adapted to either run iostat in a way that works in both older and newer versions of iostat, or get the value some other way.  There. Analysis done ;)",COMMENT

Is this a feature of LMDE ?  Looks like this really is a difference between Ubuntu and Debian (thus also between Mint and LMDE). Debian just does not add /sbin and /usr/sbin to the path of any other user than root. E.g. here is a related comment: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/232782/is-there-a-reason-i-would-not-add-usr-local-sbin-usr-sbin-sbin-to-my-path-o  &gt; Take a look at menu applets. Specifically, the code handling building the categories also can handle fetching the desktop apps by iterating app_system.get_tree().  Isn't get_tree() being obsoleted in recent gtk? But mainly, will this return also programs which have binaries not in path, and not in the menu system? Bumblebeed is not an desktop app...  Personally, I do not see much reason to check for bumblebeed binary at all, it is not being executed by the applet. It's the /proc/acpi/bbswitch which is used, and which should be (and already is, as you stated) checked for existence, correct? So maybe doing explicit check for the bbswitch file in place of the binary check and displaying the error if not found would make more sense.  Anyway, thanks for your fast response and your time you spend on this.",COMMENT

The logic in the extra check was to give a warning which included an indication of what to do before the applet loop started to run. I can do the same with a check of the presence of /proc/acpi/bbswitch at the start but my current code lacks elegance at present.   The check for a daemon/program by GLib.find_program_in_path(&quot;program&quot;) is also used in other applets (including another of mine and 7 others) and in fact I was advised to use it to ensure dependencies were met in applets. Your input is valuable as I had no idea that Debian and Ubuntu differed in this important aspect.   @mtwebster You may be interested or even wish to take part in this conversation!,COMMENT

This is sort of an ugly area - I hate snooping around files from an applet, but it's unavoidable.  Definitely for executables, g_find_program_in_path is best - as mentioned the app sys works from our menu tree, which is populated solely via desktop files.  For normal files, I'd use g_file_test - *don't* use g_file_query_exists (it blocks).  Using g_file_query_info, you can construct an asynchronous version of checking whether a file exists, but I'm not sure it's worth it here, g_file_test should do the trick.   It does make me wonder if we would benefit from a nice rolled-up function that any applet could use - an  asynchronous file existence check.",COMMENT

How does one know if functions are asynchronous?  Your idea of a nice rolled-up function that any applet could use - an asynchronous file existence check seems sensible or a well tested example for people to follow when checking for 'dependencies' being met for an applet.  Is there actually anything against using try and catch with a file read as an alternative if one has to eventually read a file's contents as I do in my bumblebee applet?  One of the major problems I find with use of the synchronous functions is that it trips the dangerous flag and associated warnings which puts people off using applets regardless of whether it is a real problem or not - do we need a mechanism for reviewing applets so that the warnings can be removed or at least tone down if problems are unlikely?",COMMENT

I have finished all changes. Below are the changes:  &gt;     The order in the applet menu is now a bit confusing. Maybe there should be a redshift-one shot section and then a redshift-automatic change section. Right now it's a bit mixed up and I think not clear what the two buttons do. Configuration menu is divided in three sections now. Also, Redshift switch has been pushed just before day/oneshot settings. Hence, in the applet each switch is the separator of each section: general brightness on top, enable/disable Redshift marks Redshift options and Transition on night switch marks night options. It could be a bit confusing that day brightness and colour values are also used in oneshot mode, but I think that adding two more sliders would be weird and the applet too much big. So, oneshot mode is like saying that it is always daylight.  &gt;     The two buttons don't interact well. For example if you have both on and turn off the night change, the one-shot is not activated. I guess one should be set to off if the other is activated when changing the one-shot settings on the sliders there is now a flickering that I think wasn't there before Bug when changing applet modes have been fixed. Now, one or two seconds happens between changing modes but this is the time lapsed on killing old Redshift transition mode. Flickering has also been fixed launching redshift -x command only on disabled mode. However, in transition mode a bit of flickering happends because Redshift reset temperature and bright to the maximum and then gradually changes color to the corresponding time.  &gt;     the brightness can be displayed as 57.9999999999% which should be rounded I have not seen never brightness with decimals, and in the code I see rounds in all functions. Could you please fix it if you detect it?  &gt;    I guess nice to have the changing icons! But since my original intention was to imitate a sun-set maybe we could have a day-sun and a sunset-sun? Or a sun and a moon? Opinions?  I think you will love the new icons! Now a black light bulb is used for disabled Redshift, a red light bulb is used for oneshot mode and a red sunset is used for transition mode. Icons have been modified from Material icons.  &gt;     also I'd update the Readme to include the new features Readme has been updated   I hope you like all the changes!  Below, the TO-DO tasks: - I have updated pot file and Spanish po file, but german and chiness translations should be done. - In spite of regenerate pot file and translating to Spanish, I only can see translated the 'brightness' string (that come from the forked applet for you). I have never worked with pot, so I don't know if something more has to be done for translations appear.  And lastly a notice: as settings schema has been changed, you have to delete your ~/.cinnamon/configs/redshift@marvel4u folder to reload the new schema and see the changes. I suppose that Cinnamon will do it when the applet be installed in users computer using Cinnamon applet settings.   Thanks and regards.",COMMENT

The brighness slider does also not work for me, but why the Cinnamon-settings-daemon crashes on startup in my system. If you see an error similar to this in ~ /.cinnamon/glass.log, probably this is the cause: Error getting Cinnamon backlight power settings true,,Error: GDBus.Error:org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.ServiceUnknown:.  About your suggestions, I think that the applet should not be more saturated. However, having **in the tooltip** current location and max and min brightness and color temperature (only current in one-shot mode) would be nice. I think that current color temperature doesn't worth, since it requires executing Redshift in verbose mode and saving constantly the standard output (I think that Redshift-gtk does it this way, and Redshift has not another option for doing it).  About language, I think that it has to be related with some cache, since I have fully uninstalled the applet and installed from Cinnamon Settings and not I see configuration window translated (though the applet remains in English). @Marvel4U, when you do something more with translations, I have just discover a bug: 'ongitud' must be 'Longitud' in Spanish es.po.  In any case, I think that one issue should be opened for translation fixes and another one for your suggestions, since they are a bit out of scope of this pull request and it has already be merged.

Once I set up the color temperature, I don't want to change them anymore very often. Also I don't want to change them by accident, which can happen very fast, since the sliders are in the pop up. I would just show the needed infos about color temperature and location and the switches. And I would show the sliders only in the settings. It's hard to adjust them anyway. They jump with steps of 50, i.e. it's hard to set a temperature of exactly 6500. You have to type it in the settings.",COMMENT

Another example is people that don't use transition between day and night and want one-shot mode in their way. In addition, maybe not all people know applet settings.  Initially the applet had not settings, they are specially useful for remember user values instead loading defaults in each system startup.  It's true that setting the exact value in the applet is not easy, but I think that many people would play with values until get a confortable set of values, and this is difficult in changing values in settings.  In conclusion, although a bit replicated, settings in applet and applet settings are complementary. I think that it would be very useful having a fast summary in applet tooltip but, as I commented in my previous comment, this is not so easy (specially current Redshift calculated value, the rest of values are feasible with a bit of work).

For some reason, get_netlist function is not exported through GObject introspection (its gir file contains &quot;introspectable=0&quot;), although netlist structure is, but it can't be used for anything without that function. I am not sure where this problem comes from and if something can be done about it, since I don't understand GObject introspection that well.  Older versions of this applet used network manager to retrieve a list of network interfaces. Not everyone uses network manager, so I dropped this dependency in favor of glibtop's netlist feature. I can add fallback to either network manager or use directly /sys/class/net to retrieve the interfaces. I think the latter is better, because it doesn't create any additional dependency.

I'm currently working on code that checks if an actor is visible using position, width, and height on ```scroll-event```, so it only adds actors to the parent if they're visible (or perhaps hides them if they're not). ```Clutter.Actor.is_visible()``` is unfortunately assuming anything on the stage is visible.

If it is *enabled* and there is nothing in the logs to explain why it's not working then we should take a look at the geometry of your panels.   * Could you show me the results of:  `dconf read /org/cinnamon/enabled-applets` * Does running the `uninstall.sh` script restore a working original window-list applet? If not there is definitely something screwy going on with your panels. (The `install.sh` can be run to replace/reinstall my applet to the correct place as necessary.)  HTH,COMMENT

If I call those functions from glibtop, that error is thrown in some part of Cinnamon initialization, but if I call string match() function right after glibtop init, the error is thrown by match() (which can be caught with try-catch) and then everything works fine. It makes no sense to me, but for some reason this workaround works, at least in Fedora 25.

Though I must say, I thought it was more like the [Windows 7 like arrow](https://www.sevenforums.com/attachments/tutorials/328687d1407639595-notification-area-icons-hide-show-system-icons-notifications-notfication_area_icons.png). But it isn't. After trying it, I must say, I would wish it would be more like the Windows 7 arrow. I.e. concrete things that I'd like to see improved (in my opinion): 1. When I press the applet, a popup menu appears, with all applets listed in it. If I press those icons in the popup menu, I expect, it opens the applet, but all it does is toggling visibility of those applets. (But I thinks that's not the intention and would be hard to implement.) Just irritated for the first few minutes, because I expected something else. So forget about this point ^^ 2. If I hide applets and restart Cinnamon, the hidden applets are no more hidden. I.e. your applet doesn't remember, which applets are hidden. 3. It's not visible in the popupmenu, which applets are hidden and which ones are not. That's an issue imo. You should highlight, if an applet is hidden and unhighlight, if it's visible. (Maybe using pseudo style class &quot;hover&quot; or &quot;focus&quot; or something like that) 4. You use other/bigger icons in the popup, than those on the panel.  Some applets have the same icon or just a &quot;? question mark&quot; as icon. Therefore it's irritating at first to see, which icons belongs to which applet. It would be better, if you would use the same (symbolic) icons as in the panel. (I think it's hard to get them?). I would at least change the following: * Use smaller icon size by default (size 22 or what is the default? Since it's possible in the panel settings to &quot;allow cinnamon to change the icon size depending on the panel size&quot;, maybe it's also possible to get the icon size of the icons in the panel. Then I would add an option, &quot;Use same size for icons as the panel does&quot; by default and add an option to set custom icon size.) * The systray@cinnamon.org uses a question-mark as icon. But it definitely has a icon. 5. The icon of your applet is white. It should use the same color as the other symbolic icons in the panel.",COMMENT

Regarding the mentioned remarks: 1. The applet toggles visitbilities of applets in the popup instead of opening them or simulating a left click. 2. The applet saves information about last used values to the CSV file located in: `~/.local/share/cinnamon/applets/hideable-applets@cardsurf/values/last_values.csv`. If a user hide/unhide an applet and immediately restart Cinnamon the changes will not be retained. A saving interval can be configured in the settings under the `Save every` option. Is there a better way to save many values using Cinnamon built-in settings without high CPU usage ?  3. Sounds like a nice improvement. 4. A default icon size is 40 pixels. This can be customized under the `Icon size` option in the configuration.     There could also be a button that sets the icon size to match a panel size.    Right now the applet looks for applet icons in the: `/.local/share/cinnamon/applets/` directory or in an applet metadata. If an icon is not found it displays the question mark icon. The applet could also check if an `icon.png` file exists in: `/usr/share/cinnamon/applets` to show more applet icons. 5. Is there any good small arrow up symbolic icon that could be used ?,COMMENT

This icon (along with the **pan-down**, **pan-end** and **pan-start**) *seems* to exists only on the **Adwaita** and **Hicolor** icon themes and these two icon themes *seems* to exists in all distributions (not the emphasis on **seems**, I cannot be entirely sure).  **About the icon for applets inside the menu:** You could also look for an applet icon on the applet's metadata.

Open terminal and `cd` to the UUID and then `ln -s files/UUID/README.md` should create the symbolic link. In theory this should work.  With the new changes of the spices website, there is a new feature. The website now shows CHANGELOG.md files as well like the README.md files. See https://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com/applets/view/282  I suggest to rename changelog.txt to CHANGELOG.md and add a symbolic link as well like with the README.md file.

I think an experiment on something unimportant might be sensible before I change them all. It only takes a few seconds to do an extra save after the changes have been made.  I will now start to change my changelog.txt files to CHANGELOG.md and copy so they are visible on web site.

If you are prepared to try this out and see if the web site picks up the link correctly please take off the [WIP] and merge this PR.

I would be happy with having regex list as a single plain text input field, but it could be fancier if someone had time to implement a reorderable list with editable name, regex and 2 colors for each row.  Need to scroll NIC list should never arise with such implementation, since it's inconceivable that one could want a few dozen unmarked overlayed graphs in their tray: too hard to distinguish that many colors and remember which is which.

It's baffling because the warnings you posted here point to a basic logical mistake in my applet, i.e. that this._orientation and this.verticalCollapseIconName aren't set. But, I set those right during the initialization. That means, if this fails for you due to compatibility issues, there should be tons of other variables that shouldn't be known as well and the whole applet wouldn't work in the slightest. So what this looks like to me is that some of my changes weren't applied, especially the ones in the applet's initialization stage.",COMMENT

At this point, the settings and several variables haven't been initialized yet. The old engine wasn't bothered by that, but it looks like the new one is. :)  So I'll change that behavior and if I still can't get it working for you, I'll just update the metadata as you said earlier.",COMMENT

Only when author/maintainer changes.) ([Example](https://github.com/linuxmint/cinnamon-spices-applets/pull/672/files)) The UUID of the applet won't be changed (because users won't get any updates, if we would change that), so your name stays there as well.  But I can't promise, that your name in the code (applet.js etc.) will stay, if someone decides to take over the code. You can create a PR to change `author` to `original_author` in your code. This way it has at least more chance to stay there.  @SavageTiger @gnemonix  You set +0.5. It means you are no longer actively supporting your applet (new features, etc.)? Shall we leave your name as author? It means you will be notified, when somebody creates a PR, since your name is still there as author. If we set the author name to `none`, you probably won't be notified and maybe some other developer comes along and says he wants to maintain it. ",COMMENT

I'm sure many of the people tagged in this post are getting pretty sick of all the emails and notifications in this post, so I'm going to go ahead and lock this.  If you stumble on this post for the first time and you have an applet, desklet, or extension that was migrated from the old spices site, and haven't commented yet, here's what you need to do: * if you no longer wish to maintain your applet, desklet, or extension, at this point we've probably already assumed that your spice was abandoned anyway. In this case no action is required on your part. * If you do wish to maintain your spice first check the 'author' field in the file ```info.json``` located in the root folder of your spice. If it is set to none, this means that we have assumed that it was abandoned. In this case, simply submit a pull request changing the author field to your Github name and in the comments explain that you are the original author and wish to continue maintaining the spice. * If you wish for your code to be removed from the spices website, submit a pull request which removes the root folder of your spice from the repository. Please also explain in the comments that you are the original author and that you wish to remove the spice from the website and the repository.",COMMENT

I configured the virtual machines with the same IP-Adress for automation-reasons. I often have to switch between Projects, so I have to stop the running machine and start another one (because running two machines with the same IP results in conflicts and unexpected behaviour). I mean I have to start/stop the machines with the vagrant-commands anyway but it would help a lot if I had an indicator what machine is running. I have now the VirtualBox Manager open all the time.  Maybe my use case is too special, but I think having little indicators for each machine and maybe also the possibility to start, stop, suspend, resume the machines directly from the tray would be very nice - for everybody using VirtualBox.  Using the status icons from VirtualBox would make sense for me. Looking at the tray from the external drives ... something like this. Status icon in front of each line and on the right like the &quot;unmount-icon&quot; some action icons like start, stop (and may some more)  Should be possible if I look e.g. at the tray from the sound-applet...  I never did something like this and and have sadly no time to dive into it, so I can give no help for implementing, but I could do a little design-shot if this helps.

It could be a user choice to use the same on a horizontal panel.  * The fork by @marmistrz would also need changes to work on a vertical panel and needs Translation support etc as well as a README.md   * I intend to modify several of my applets to work with a vertical panel and Bumblebee and the Battery Monitor with Alerts and Shutdown (BAMS) are top of my list but on a time-scale of weeks not days.  In summary:  * In a month or two I should be able to offer a choice of the two UIs and the fork by @marmistrz would not be essential.

It may also help identify abandoned applets. Great work but could end up with unintended consequences when you identify strings and create the .pot files rather than just an extra .po.  Another thing to watch is that some applets get the UUID from metadata.uuid already so not a good idea to add a `const UUID ` even if scoping saves the day. Keep up the great work,COMMENT

It brings more attention to a lot of applets that otherwise would be lost in obscurity.  I had my doubts at first, but I have come around to the idea of it after seeing how much better the quality is. Its allowed me to fix a bug in the weather applet that's annoyed me. I've seen more help with translations on my own applets. I think the whole point of writing these extensions is to improve Cinnamon. At the end of the day your applet is going to be on Github, whether its here, or on your account I think is a minor difference. You in particular GPL licensed your work, that is free software.

I enjoyed working with you on Mint code, you were knowledgeable and inventive, and you helped me solve some problems.  We are all part of a small community trying to move things forward and to do the right thing for those who use our open source software.  Adding translations would seem to be one of those things that is so obviously going to be of benefit to our users.  It's something that is fundamentally aligned to the open source ethos, with people from different countries contributing their language skills, so more people can use our code.  And with gettext tools it is largely independent of writing the application code. So although I can see you appear to be upset and angry, I don't really understand why.

I want to be the manager, the author, and the developer of my projects, if is not in that way i don't want to do it.  In the new model, I'm not the manager of my own code, it's @clefebvre, as it's the leader of the Mint team. In my head, I have never developed a software for Mint. I create free software, as cinnamon it's a cross desktop that can be installed in different distros. I add cross code to cinnamon only because of it.  If i was wrong and always was Mint software only, sorry, i was who is wrong. Also in my own code that i develop outside here.  If it's free software, why my code is lead by other person and why this other person can decide or change something for little that it was without ask to the author or the manager **and then published it how it was doing by the author (the change need to say do by Mint at less)**?  I don't agree with anything of it and more than that i think this not good for cinnamon at all, as rules are impositions that limited the freedom for create software.   All this have a different perception of course. Freedom and security are two words where in software like in life, they go always in opposite directions.  In that point we are in opposite directions then, as by concept, as by law, the free software it's without any warranty. So, i don't understand what is this, but it's not what the licence of the code say. What i do say clear in the license is: without any warranty. The mint warranty don't say me anything, just it changed  what i say.  Sorry, if this could create problems to you or anyone, this create problems to me. Most of you only do what the lead say, and how this was his idea, need to be also only his matter, and not anything else. I know is not in this way.",COMMENT

When I discovered the why, I simply desisted of the idea of changing it to avoid useless discussions and headaches. So I created my own version of the cinnamon-json-makepot.py script with the correct argument for js files (`--language=JavaScript`), plus I added to it support to scan Python files and to blacklist keys found on the settings-schema.json file.  Using the wrong language for the `--language` argument can bring unforeseen complications. It might throw warnings that shouldn't throw and **it will** insert wrong comments into the .pot files for one. Using the wrong language to scan Python files can throw actual errors, even from strings found inside comments. &not;&not;  As for following conventions, we should be following Cinnamon's conventions, not Gnome's. [And Cinnamon uses `--language=JavaScript` argument for `xgettext` to scan JavaScript code for the generation of the cinnamon.pot file](https://github.com/linuxmint/Cinnamon/blob/cd180f074d5d450f3442613b4827f7aa4c987cd5/makepot#L6).

Perhaps it could be helpfull to consider, what happens within the ITM  app, if preferences (title, app, focused, no) are changed.  In Libreoffice calc the behavior is little bit different.

That's the reason I'm using a lambda (inline function). There are other options as well (defining it initially with `let` or `var` and, then, either assign it to a constant or just use it like that, for instance).

Any comments or corrections are welcome.  @NikoKrause has also written a  a quick tutorial on How to add l10n/translation support to an applet at NikoKrause/CinnVIIStarkMenu#19 which may help fill in another missing area of documentation.  @ everyone: Where should discussions such as this and documentation be held - a closed PR is obviously not the ideal place! I have raised the problems of documentation several times before as the little that exists for applets is scattered and much is for earlier versions of Cinnamon with a few occasional words of wisdom in Segfault updating things and now the README.md for the spices repositories.

It probably would be a good idea to provide some docs here for working with, and submitting to, this repo.  In general your commits should not have all of those merge commits of upstream/master in them. If you want to pull upstream changes into a branch you are working on you should first update your master branch. `git checkout master` followed by `git fetch upstream` and `git merge upstream/master`.  Once you do that you can checkout your working branch branch and run `git rebase master`. That will cleanly add all of the upstream changes to your working branch without all the merge commmits.

I am glad you show the mechanisms to ensure that the author is alerted to the PL and given the chance to comment.   Is it however better to tidy up the Branch after the Pull Request has been successfully merged and closed rather than keep every update in a separate branch by deleting it on the local copy and on origin? This can be done by:  ``` git push origin --delete &lt;branch_name&gt; git branch -D &lt;branch_name&gt; ```  Note1:  the forced delete is deliberate as it means that one does not need to merge the branch before deleting as it will eventually appear via the Pull Request from origin to upstream and then the pull from upstream to master. Note 2; For completeness I believe that when you are working on several machines you may need to purge the stale branch  on the other machines by something like `git fetch --all --prune` on each machine  This keeps your local master and upstream master looking more like upstream and it should have all your commits made to the branch in it via the successful PL including changes made during the merge cycle such as squashing which @brownsr indicated could take place.

I would never have started if the situation had been like this a few years ago, even building on an existing applet as I did. I only started to use git when I had several applets and felt a formal version control was becoming essential and it was (and still is) a steep learning curve to climb.

This is what is in the Readme although I think that should be changed to emphasize the requirement for it being a critical or security nature before a PR is merged without consultation when there is an active developer.   The problem is that and changes can have unintended consequences and apparently 'helpful' and well intended changes made to my applets have actually removed functionality from five applets of my applets - some have been reversed for me but 5 are outstanding and I will probably have to create PLs to reverse them. Worse still is that I only discovered the changes by chance! This is a matter of Trust. If I can not trust that my own applets work as I wrote them (and as their documentation indicates they should work) who else will trust them.

There could be an authenticated way for xlet authors to update their xlet - through the Spices website, and it could overwrite any changes. To do that the server would need to extract the zip, and open an automated PR that would be approved manually for malware checks. Maybe they can update their model to add a field indicating a user is trusted, then it would be automatically merged. Then on approval, it could trigger an event that would overwrite the existing zip file. This would prevent the need for maintaining our own fork, and making sure nothing is conflicting.  It could give some control back to the authors that want it, and preserve this repo as a back-end.  An example repository that has a bot doing this would be [jsDelivr](https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr). Also see [jsDelivr bot](https://github.com/jsdelivr/bot).",COMMENT

I think that's important and bug fixers should be empowered, just like authors themselves.  That said, if a mistake is made, it's also EXTREMELY important, we're able (and that includes the author via PR) to revert it. That's not possible if a PR spans across multiple spices.  For this reason I think this particular PR should have been rejected. I don't see any reason to revert it.... but it is hard to review, and if there was anything wrong in it, it would be VERY DIFFICULT for an author to revert the changes on his/her applet without reverting the whole thing.. assuming that's possible.  Now, on the workflow itself... I've talked about it a lot already, both on github and internally.  &gt; I do not believe that multiple changes or any changes other than those Essential for a critical security fix should be made without consultation with the author (if active).   Changes should be small and modular, I think we strongly agree on that.  Bug fixes in general, and that includes missing or outdated translations, or changes required as a consequence of changes happening in Cinnamon, or missing core features (highlighting, integration..etc) should be accepted.  &gt; This is what is in the Readme although I think that should be changed to emphasize the requirement for it being a critical or security nature before a PR is merged without consultation when there is an active developer.  I disagree. If something is broken and a fix is provided, the interest of the user lies in it being merged.  &gt; The problem is that and changes can have unintended consequences and apparently 'helpful' and well intended changes made to my applets have actually removed functionality from five applets of my applets - some have been reversed for me but 5 are outstanding and I will probably have to create PLs to reverse them.   That happens everywhere, but if we can help with that or if there's a case we don't understand, I'd like to know more about this so we can get the opportunity to think about it. Can you explain what happened in details here?  &gt; Worse still is that I only discovered the changes by chance! This is a matter of Trust. If I can not trust that my own applets work as I wrote them (and as their documentation indicates they should work) who else will trust them.  That's a workflow issue is it? You can see the git history for your spice.. I don't understand how you wouldn't be able to see that.  In regards to trust, think of it from another point of view. We're the ones distributing that spice. People do not download it from you, they install a Cinnamon spice. When it doesn't work, they think Cinnamon doesn't work. If they report a bug and we think it's important we want to be able to fix it.  &gt; As @jaszhix wrote I would have done this differently but there was no consultation before this was brought in but we now have to live with it and ensure that we all get the benefits the new system should bring but without losing existing applet writers and inhibiting any new writers from starting.  It's never nice to lose people and I completely understand your point of view. We've changed things from a real 3rd party collection of applets to something tightly controlling and which removes a lot of power from authors, and you said, it came out of the blue without consultation. I completely understand where you're coming from, and I also understand why some people prefer to leave.  This was necessary though and it's a huge improvement long term for Cinnamon and Cinnamon users, even if we lose quality spices in the process.  We're losing active devs who drive the development of their spices in isolation, some of them really good spices. We're also opening up and making it easier for other people to bug fix and contribute though. Look at all these translations, we'd never have seen that on so many spices before. And when the time comes to add new features into Cinnamon we'll be able to add support to all spices as well, ourselves, and that's a huge improvement as well.  In regards to consultation, it was brutal and I'm sorry and it had to be done in secrecy. You might remember that uploading was closed down temporarily before the new workflow was ready. We talked about it for weeks internally but I couldn't leak the info. I don't know if you're aware of it, but we're targeted specifically and in terms of security Cinnamon Spices were a huge Achilles Heel. We're quite lucky nobody used it to upload malicious code, it was a catastrophe waiting to happen. After we were targeted and this security hole was identified, this change of workflow had to happen urgently and it's a huge relief to see it implemented. ",COMMENT

As far as the changes to 5 of my applets, that was a multiple change #148 which was made to tidy up the placement of README.md and changelog files which in my case moved them all from the applet folder to a higher level. Unfortunately in my case I had my helpfiles and changelogs where accessible from within the applets from a sub-menu of the context (right click menu) so they could be read easily by the user without going to the repository or the cinnamon spices web site. I therefore have near identical README.md files in two places.  As far as not seeing the changes: That was because the Pull Request did not mention specific authors so I was not notified or the fact that it was moving changelog files as well as the README.md files which I had already put in the correct place so there was nothing to alert me to changes. At the time I was using expensive mobile or satellite connections so I was not looking in detail at the repositories unless there was a need so the first time I saw a problem was when I used the facility on my own applet and it did not work.   That sort of problem should not happen again as it is stressed in many places that the author must be mentioned by a @author to ensure he is notified and the dangers of multiple updates are now appreciated.  I like to think my applets are better documented than most but they also include a number of workarounds to get round some previous problems in cinnamon/mint/ubuntu which were beyond our control (for example see Cinnamon segfault issue 2835) where only those involved would understand the reasons for odd coding in my applet! There are many things I would do differently starting now but it would take a lot of time and testing to tidy up an old applet proven over many versions of Cinnamon and my fear is that risks outweigh the advantages. If it ain't broke don't fix it.  In my post above I also said I was putting together some further thoughts on Trust and I finally put some into your article on Segfault on Changes to cinnamon spices for developer and artists which I will repeat below.   I believe Applets need some form of score to replace the old user comments and ranking so a user knows he can trust that they will be useful, do what they say and not damage his system. I have put some thought into this over the last few weeks and to start discussion going I put forward the suggestion that some factors are * Author (identified and currently committed to development and maintenance &ndash; 3), * Documentation (description, rationale, help, version history etc &ndash; 3), * Status/Maturity (time available and number of releases, alpha, beta, released etc &ndash; 3), * Best Practice (Follows coding guidelines, commented or documented code so it can be followed and checked, consistency of interface with rest of Cinnamon, compatibility with a range of themes) &ndash; Difficult to give a max score as this will always be a moving target so say 2 * Independent Assessment/Support (Do other trusted people support, check code, test and vouch for functionality &ndash; ?? ). * Extra points perhaps for translation support (1) and other things I have not thought about.  The above are in approximate order of progression that a new author and applet might reasonably achieve. If the first five are given 3 points a score of over say 10 should give confidence for to any normal user to install and full house should be at least as trustworthy as system applet &ndash; lower scores imply that a user should do some preparation and be sure it is useful to them or wait until it is further developed. Who should do the initial scoring? Probably the author &ndash; I have found managing people they usually assess their own work lower than their managers and you need to trust the author in any case. Obviously the team would spot big anomalies and could ask the author to justify his score.  I also believe that _the first time_ an applet is installed it should be via the spices web site otherwise there is no information available to advise the user who may just experiment without realising that other software may need to be installed or that some applets are only relevant to certain hardware configurations.",COMMENT

And then there is a [LINGUAS environment](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/Installers.html#Installers) variable used to limit the languages that will be installed.

The updated settings would have been nice to know, I have been redoing the feed management stuff.   Question about the new settings api @collinss, and this is why I am currently limiting to 1 instance of the applet.   Currently, if you have multiple applet instances, when a user adds a new instance of the applet it creates a new &quot;instanceid.json&quot; settings file.   However, when you remove that instance the settings file goes away (including all the feeds). SO if you are on a laptop, and have the applet on a panel on a secondary screen and take the applet off, the applet no longer is visible (another bug, it really should move, temporarily, to a visible panel), and you remove that applet and then add it to the visible panel, all settings (feeds) are lost.  Will this be the same with the new settings api?  Reproduce using feeds as example:    1.  If you currently have any feeds back them up.   2.  Remove any instances of feeds   3.  Change max-instances to 3 (any number above 1) in feeds metadata.json   4.  Add feed to a panel   5.  Note that NNN.json is created in .cinnamon/configs/uuid   6.  Remove that instance   7.  Note that NNN.json is now gone, along with any feeds in it.  Note that if the panel on a detached monitor has the applet, you would have to either: 1. remove it and add it  2. add a new instance (which would have a new NNN.json file)   Moving is not an option without the monitor attached, as in the case of a laptop with a docking station.  So I have made upcoming changes to compensate for this current functionality.  ________________________________ From: Stephen Collins &lt;notifications@github.com&gt; Sent: Thursday, February 23, 2017 11:39 AM To: linuxmint/cinnamon-spices-applets Cc: Jason Jackson; Mention Subject: [linuxmint/cinnamon-spices-applets] feeds@jonbrettdev.wordpress.com: fix some variable warnings (#154)   @jake1164&lt;https://github.com/jake1164&gt; Thought I'd run this by you before merging in case it interferes with your workflow.

The problem seems to be in the `_updateDevice()` function and errors show in the glass log file.  It looks as if it only worked if the interface was eth0 because that was set in the catch (e) at the end of the routine. It can be made to sort of work if the device is set to the interface one is using at that point. I will try to have a look over the next few days and in the limit I may be able to patch in the function I use in NUMA which does work and allows me to display the vnstati output.

My immediate thought on opening it was 'what are these additional entries in the column on the left'.  I soon realised that they are similar to the favourites bar in the standard menu, with additional mode switching buttons above.  That made me realise just how well the standard menu hid complexity by using a few icons in contrast to the list format of the main menu categories.  You might like to think about how to reduce visual complexity for the user. What is in a favourites bar in the standard menu appears to be broken up into three here, with mode switches above, a list of favourites, and a second list at the bottom for power and lock functions.  It would be better to my eyes if these three elements were combined visually, perhaps. It wasn't hard to find the odd issue, but for a work in progress that's to be expected.  All in all this looks promising.  If you can make the complex twiddles in the user interface disappear and so simplify it visually then that would be even better.  I liked the way that the favourite apps can appear as a category.  But using this gives the same information as in the column to the left, which looked odd. If you have the favourite apps as a menu category do you also need them listed to the left ? I imagine there is an icon missing, as the mode switch button to the left of the list/grid mode switch came up blank for me.

To me as a developer and power user, this currently suits my needs. I could see the UX for most people being improved in the ways you suggested, which is definitely interesting to think about. I agree the current default applet is very good, and I've used it for a long time. I think condensing some of these elements and making the interface's features more obvious is a good first step in that direction.  As far as Cinnamon integration, if it makes you feel better, I ported it with a less opinionated work flow and use of libraries, in case it is used as a base for other projects. Its not exactly adhering to Mint's style guide, but its basically there if you format it to four space indentation.  Edit:  &gt; If you have the favourite apps as a menu category do you also need them listed to the left ?  The default option for the left column is Favorites, but I switched it to Places - for some reason I thought it was the default option. It could be, and I goofed up the conversion of the schema to JSON settings. (Edit: Yep) My guess is one feature (toggling the left column between favorites/places) came before the other when the original version was being developed, and the redundancy happened.  As for the missing icon on the startup apps display toggle, I haven't experienced that. The screenshot I posted represents what it looks like for me consistently.  &gt; Happy to do some more detailed testing when you would find that helpful.  Thanks! Anytime is okay, and I will catch up with you later if I'm busy.",COMMENT

The only place I can see what each corresponds to is at the bottom right of the whole menu. That's a long way to look across for a description and makes mouse control a bit awkward.  Yeah, that's why I gave them labels. You're right, we may want to kill that column and move it to the category list.  &gt; Some of the favourite apps are coming up with '-' on the line underneath them  This is actually a feature, but its not obvious what it means.

Perhaps the control toggles and search bar can be moved left to allow this to be closed down ?  I like that idea.  &gt; The search functionality appears to be searching the applet names fine, but is not bringing up things using the description. The word 'document' gets very different results in this menu compared to the default menu, for example  I carried over Icing Menu's search method over (uses [this](https://github.com/miguelmota/knuth-morris-pratt/)), because I found sometimes I would get the wrong results when searching the default way. Like searching for &quot;settings&quot; brings up everything but settings.

I'd be tempted to remove it, as the way that the favourites appear as the first category makes them easy to locate, so I can't see that a way to reduce the applet list to just the favourites adds anything.  I agree, it seems a bit unnecessary and there's a bit of a lag if it opens with &quot;All applications&quot; because it has to render the biggest list on init, which isn't likely what the user will be wanting to see, looking through a huge list (not me anyway).   &gt; There are missing icons for toggle startup apps view, restart, logout user and preferences (bottom right)  This is not what I'm seeing.

Or maybe purge some of these settings.  Thanks for the feedback.  Edit: Another thing I want to do is re-add the context menu, and I'm wondering if there's a way to fake a popup on a popup with the z-index property? If not, any suggestion on an intuitive way to do this in a grid?  Edit 2: What do you guys think about creating a column right of the application list, that displays the context menu options when an app is right clicked? This would be after removing the far left column so it doesn't get too wide. We could either expand the menu when this happens, or shrink the app list container.",COMMENT

I'm still thinking about how I want to handle the context menu - I copied over the base context menu class from the default applet, but seems like it will have to be integrated differently because I'm using different kinds of actors for the menu items.  Edit:  I think I fixed the category button getting stuck with the CSS update yesterday. The bookmarks work like the other category buttons, it just needs to be hovered over to show its contents. I noticed it will only index bookmarks at the root level of the bookmark tree structure in each browser, so if you neatly organize all of them in folders none will show.

In order for this to show in your applet page on the spices website, it should be in uuid/ along with your info.json, icon.png, and screenshot.png * Line 101 in applet.js uses a synchronous call. This is usually not a problem as most such commands finish very quickly, but it does freeze Cinnamon while it is running (that's how synchronous calls work). If the command takes longer than normal for some reason, the freezes will become noticeable to the user and could even hang the ui indefinitely if the script fails to terminate. You should change this to an async call instead. If you need an example of how to do this, I did the same thing with one of my applets [here](https://github.com/linuxmint/cinnamon-spices-applets/commit/9d81d620befd5f757aae30f0a8af35caecef6f5d). * In metadata.json, you have an extra argument ```&quot;dangerous&quot;: true``` which probably shouldn't be there. It is autogenerated by Cinnamon when the applet is added, and is used to identify to the user any applets that have calls that are potentially &quot;dangerous&quot; (have been known to cause freezes/crashes/etc). In your case it is set to true because of the synchronous call I mentioned in my previous point. It would probably be best to just remove that argument from your pr entirely.",COMMENT

I as a reviewer can't see what's in the .mo file. I can look at an image file though.  Your manual way of handling this is way too complicated. All you have to do is to store the .po files in a directory called po. Done. Nothing else.  If you install your applet through System Settings, Cinnamon checks for the po directory and creates the .mo files in the needed path.  I don't know what's the opinion of others. Better ask @collinss",COMMENT

Applet developers are a particularly transient bunch (as a whole, not individually). We never know who will decide to abandon their applets, and we need to be able to maintain it if that happens. We can't afford to have exceptions, either.  Now I realize that .mo files are a little different than an executable binary, but since we have a mechanism to generate the .mo files at install time, I would prefer to use that moving forward.  That being said, I agree that we can't just implement new rules without warning and expect everyone to bend over backwards to comply immediately. I don't think it's unreasonable to give some time before this policy on .mo files needs to be enforced. In the mean time, I will add this to the readme, and we'll be cleaning up the other applets that have binary data. I will also merge this PR, but please look into making the change at your earliest convenience. If you need some help, or guidance, don't hesitate to ask either.",COMMENT

It works for CJS as well after I submitted a PR, and the author implemented it. It does however only fake the Node environment, and any code that needs to be modified to run for CJS, won't work with it either - it adds the module system, and syntactic sugar.   I also have made a few Electron apps for work and as side projects - its a really convenient way to create standalone apps if you are familiar with browser and node JS. The main thing Node and G/CJS have in common is they're wrappers for native C bindings, and you can do a lot of powerful things natively with them. I think if more distributions installed Node by default like they do Python, you would see more Node integration in the Linux free desktop ecosystems.",COMMENT

But it's up to you. 2. The loadOptions function looks strange. Is it on purpose? 3. Last-edited in metadata.json is added automatically as far as I know. I don't know, if this will cause problems, when you add it manually. 4. What's the purpose of &quot;repo&quot; in info.json? Is it used somewhere? Haven't seen it before. You can use &quot;website&quot; in metadata.json instead, to link to your applets website.  And last but not least: My biggest concern is the uuid you are using in metadata.json. It should match with the directory name of the applet. Else it will fail to load, if I remember correctly.",COMMENT

It seems to work normally now. I can install and update the feeds@jonbrettdev.wordpress.com applet from System Settings.  It's worth noticing the following: - In my Cinnamon 3.0.7 LM 18 system I had the feeds@jonbrettdev.wordpress.com applet installed manually. It was still impossible to update it from the applets manager. I had to remove the applet and delete its settings folder and then I was able to install it from the applets manager. - In my Cinnamon 3.2.8 LM 18.1 system I hadn't this applet installed. After refreshing the applets cache, the applet installed at once without any errors. I removed it and re-installed it several times to test, and still no errors.  @jake1164  There is a typo inside the metadata.json file.

I would be very pleased if you created a PR for the Stopwatch Applet and hopefully I will be able to learn enough to do the others without too much more help.  I am currently off the coast of Brazil with poor and expensive Internet access through a satellite link so everything takes longer and the learning curve seems steeper. I do feel it important that there is a way to document some of tricks and best practice for applet writing so everyone does not reinvent wheels. This is perhaps one example. Do you have any thoughts?,COMMENT

I don't know which version of Cinnamon I was using when I installed it first. (I was moving my /home folder with me since then, and I was occasionally doing updates of the applets).

I have downloaded all the updates (they were automatically installed). 3. I restarted the cinnamon after that (ALT+F2, write 'r' and hit Enter) 4. StarkMenu started to be distorted (see 1st screenshot) 5. I downgraded the StarkMenu via my local backup &amp; restarted cinnamon. It was again working now (see 2nd screenshot).

This looks exactly like this Pull Request https://github.com/mintystark/starkmenu/pull/11, which has never been merged into StarkMenu.  &gt; I've read about how Cinnamon is stepping in, to do an intermediary between applet developers and users, to protect the users, etc.  The change to the spices is pretty new. It will need some time, to get rid of most of the bugs. So far we haven't been able to test and fix all applets. There are over 200 applets. A lot of the applets are abandoned or doubled and some need to be fixed or removed. There's still some work to do. We still have to see, which applets are still in development by their authors. Which authors are still active or willing to jump on the bandwagon. E.g. Odyseus, jaszhix are very active. Others as mintystark are gone a long time ago.  As for StarkMenu it is abandoned quite some time. As I mentioned above, I suspect that you have fixed it on your own, by adding the pull request manually. It was never updated on spices though.  For example: The checkboxes &quot;Show bookmarks and places&quot; and &quot;Show recent files&quot; in the menusettings of your fixed/working StarkMenu are broken, right?  I would recommend CinnVIIStarkMenu. It will be available here very soon. Or you can test it manually, if you can't wait. I don't think StarkMenu will be fixed, if we have a working fork of it. Unless mintystark happens to reappear and fixes it (I doubt it).  So a lot of work is still to do. Help is always appreciated.  And thanks for the feedback. It helps to know, which applets are actually used and need to be fixed in priority :)",COMMENT

Its header is malformed.  **Edit:** I see that you use custom scripts to generate your .pot files. In case that you didn't know, Cinnamon provides the command called **cinnamon-json-makepot** for that purpose. Run it from inside the applet's folder like this `cinnamon-json-makepot --js name-of-pot-file` and it will extract all strings from .js files, metadata.json and settings-schema.json",COMMENT

You don't need `generatePOT.awk` and `generatePOT.sh`. Open a terminal and go to the directory, where your `metadata.json` file is stored. Then type `cinnamon-json-makepot --js timeout@narutrey.pot` The pot file will be stored besides metadata.json and you can move it in the po directory. Or you can type `cinnamon-json-makepot --js po/timeout@narutrey.pot`. In this case the pot file in the po directory will be overwritten.  If you have updated your pot file, you can update your `ru.po` file with poedit.  1. Open your localized (translated) .po file in poedit. 2. Under &ldquo;Catalog&rdquo; top menu, select &ldquo;Update from POT file&hellip;&rdquo; menu item. 3. Select the newly downloaded .pot file and click Open in file dialog box. 4. Your files will merge and you will be shown a dialog with new and obsolete strings. 5. Proceed to translate the newly translatable strings. 6. Save and exit, your updated .po file is ready.  If you want to test your translation, then type in the same terminal (location of terminal must be again besides metadata.json) `cinnamon-json-makepot -i` This will install the po files in &quot;~/.local/share/locale/&quot;  Why is this line in your metadata: &quot;localedir&quot;: &quot;~/.local/share/locale&quot;  And the title of this pull request says timeout@libnaru.so.

The CONTRIBUTING.md file is a file that should contain contribution guidelines. The *real template* for pull requests is a file called [PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository/).  The PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md file is *half useful* in my opinion. While the pull requests messages are important, the amount and organization of the commits in a pull request are even more important. Knowing this, the content of the PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md file will appear **after** all the commits where committed (pun intended) and **after** the contributor or author did the possible mess. This leads to reviews harder than they need to be and may even force contributors and authors to learn advanced GitHub methods (to fix the possible screw ups).  On the other hand, the [ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue-template-for-your-repository/) file **it is absolutely needed and useful**. Because we can have super detailed guidelines on how to report errors, but the *bug reporters* are mostly end users. And the end users that [RTFM](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/RTFM) are an endangered species and counted with the fingers of one hand (LOL).  Speaking about guidelines. The current CONTRIBUTING.md file on this repository reads:  &gt; The title must be in the format `spice name: simple description of the problem`.  It shouldn't be *only* xlet name the one specified, but the xlet UUID also. Why? Because there are several applets with similar name or even the exact same name. So, in my opinion, it should read:  &gt; The title must be in the format **Spice name (Spice UUID): simple description of the problem**.  In my opinion, the ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md file should be created ASAP and with the following content:  ```markdown     The title of this issue must be in the format **Spice name (Spice UUID): simple description of the  problem**.      @applet_author      ### Issue description     Describe your issue in detail.      ### Steps to reproduce     1. Step one.     2. Step two.      ### System information      ```     Paste here the output of the following command run on a terminal: inxi -xxxSc0 -! 31     ``` ```  With a *fed spooned* template like this, all of you can close issues on sight with absolute zero remorse.

It's not really something they should as a general rule. If we are going to require the uuid in the title and/or the author referenced in the description, we will need to provide instructions on how to find that information. Those instructions need to consist of more than just ```right-click -&gt; about``` because at least some of the issues are going to be the applet not loading in the first place, which in turn means they can't open the about dialog.  On top of that, many of the people who report issues probably will not be repeat reporters (and may not even be familiar with github and bug reporting), so they will not be aware of the proper procedures, or how to obtain the necessary information.  Pull requests, on the other hand, will almost always be by someone who contributes regularly, so we can reasonably expect a lot more from them than the average end user.  Finally, I think it will be extremely valuable to use tags to organize the issues so that a developer can quickly check what issues are open against a particular spice.

There are so many ways that someone could insert malicious code into an applet that could circumvent whatever checks were put in place. Consider anti-virus software - no matter how good it is, it still needs the virus definitions updated regularly because it is impossible to identify all malware through algorithms alone.

If developers want to develop their applets outside of the Linux Mint organization, there is nothing stopping them. Having their work hosted on the spices website and available for download in Cinnamon settings has been a service that Linux Mint has offered for both the users and the developers. Unfortunately, over time the lax policies governing the use of that service have led to multiple complications, not and not just security issues, and so the policies had to be changed. If you wish to use those services, you should be prepared to live with the policies surrounding them. If you can't, or don't want to, you are always free to stop using the service, and have your code removed from this repo. Some have already (including Lester).  Part of the problem is that these applets are being offered through Linux Mint products and websites. From and end-user perspective, it's still coming from Linux Mint, and there are consequences to that. One is that the user will tend to trust what is downloaded because it comes (in their mind at least) from Linux Mint. Another is that when half the applets don't work, and some aren't even installable, that reflects badly on the organization.  &gt; I think what would have been more appropriate is having two tiers of applets - &quot;trusted&quot; and &quot;untrusted&quot;. Like, because I'm new I would be &quot;untrusted&quot; for a while, but then after a period of time my updates could be pushed through automatically.  That is actually how it works now, except that it's the developers who are 'new' or 'trusted'. There are some applet developers who have been around for quite a while, and are trusted enough that their code doesn't really need a review before being merged. Some of them have even been given push access to this repository, and I expect that that number will grow as time goes on.",COMMENT

Just a couple of notes. I won't reply to any comments to my comment.  &gt; offered to help with the website development (would have for free), but was ignored.  clefebvre is in charge. He has a lot of projects going on simultaneously (KDE, Xfce, MATE, Cinnamon, Spices, etc.) and a lot of channels to contact him (EMail, IRC, GitHub, LinuxMint blog, Segfault, Slack, etc.) It's hard to catch, follow and remember every single comment. I don't think your offer was ignored on purpose.  &gt; And failure to provide an API that doesn't account for compatibility.  In my experience Cinnamon is a DE, which doesn't break stuff with easy heart. They still use the old Mint-X theme by default! Some applets still work after 2-4 years. Some of the broken apps I saw were just broken, because they imported stuff they never used (e.g. binary clock desklet imported Calendar stuff and never used it). But at some point it's inevitable to break stuff (e.g. removing box pointers) without bloating your stuff. GNOME for instance seems to break their API with every release. Don't judge on that. I don't have much experience with other DE, so I don't have much to compare ;) Failures were made. That is obvious. And that's why it has been changed now. The whole process is very new to everyone. And there are sure things, which could be improved. And there are still things to come (OAuth) and will be improved. But it will grow and develop with time. New mistakes will be made as well. That's unavoidable. With every big change you have people, who say they liked the old system better or would have done this or that differently (e.g. as Ubuntu moved to Unity, Microsoft moves form Windows version to Windows version). That's naturally.   &gt; You guys assume users are not seeing that the software they are using is not coming from Mint. Published technically? I think anyone above an elementary level of cognitive abilities can see that Cinnamon spices is hosting third party content. Every applet ends with &quot;by ____&quot;.  A few years ago, when I started with Cinnamon (I was very new to Linux), I saw available applets online. And I thought they were from LinuxMint. Because the website said as well linuxmint.com. Only later I realized, that all this people offering those applets are not from LinuxMint, but pretty much everyone could upload there. As I said I was very knew to Linux per se. And I didn't knew, who belongs to LinuxMint and who not. And it's kind of frustrating, that stuff didn't installed or crashed. Also not everybody does understand English. They have to play Point&amp;Click with the applets, if they want to know what those are doing.  &gt; if LM is unwilling to compromise on features and developer input then I'm done donating to and using Linux Mint  LM is open to feature requests and improvements in my experience. But you can't expect every feature request to be implemented and done (immediately). (http://www.bartleby.com/17/1/62.html) They decided to do it this way on GitHub. It's knew and has some flaws. They have reasons to do this simple for several reasons. Having enough people to do spices as well is one of them. Spices is now a thing that needs more time to spend with than before. Time the developers would usually spend for one of the other projects or Cinnamon itself. Also you have to keep in mind. Even if you have enough people now, you don't know how long they stay. If some of them step back, you need other people do step in. (Looking at the long run.) I'm not saying that this is ideal as it is. I wasn't happy either as I heard at first, that I have to fork the whole repo with all it's applets to upload my applet. And there have been many complains since. But in the meantime I closed peace with this fact right now. (As a sitenote: Users asked for years to implement vertical panels. Now this is possible. Users also ask for years to have a Desktop grid in Cinnamon. It's something on the list for a while, but it needs time. Step by step.)  &gt; I'm never taking my applets down though because you'll just fork them back up like you did with Lester's. Which is fine, but you're still hosting his code. So you only took his name down.  As far as I know Lester removed all his applets on spices. And I haven't seen anybody uploading them since. Let me know if I'm wrong with this.  &gt; There should be more metrics to &quot;trust&quot; than time. That's not really fair.  Trust is a very complicated thing and very hard to define (speaking of setting &quot;metrics&quot; to trust). You can't set up a checklist and expect someone to trust you, if he checked everything on this list. (&lt;- a lot of stuff can discussed about this topic and it can get very philosophical. Another reason, why I don't want to reply to answer comments to the lines I write right now)  Now to getting specific. Your last Pull Request was over 5000 lines (you squashed 3 applets in there). Even with a quick glance over it, you need some time for that. That's what I meant with &quot;it's pretty knew to everyone&quot;.  We need to work out some rules. One of them will be, that it should be only 1 applet per Pull Request. That way most stuff will be merged faster. As clem said the beginning is rough and slow, but it will get faster with time.  I hoped I didn't offended or attacked anybody with the lines above. If somebody feels offended, it wasn't my intention.

Security was certainly a big one. When the spices website was first created, security was not a big issue. Cinnamon was fairly unknown, and the potential payoffs of an attack based on Cinnamon technology weren't worth the effort. However, Cinnamon and Linux Mint are now very popular, and quite well known, and that makes them a target. The hacking that you refer to is evidence of that, but I believe there were other reasons Clem was worried about security as well. It also wasn't as knee-jerk a reaction as it seemed from the outside. There have been discussions about doing this for a while, but they couldn't be made public until action was taken because it would basically be an open invitation for someone to exploit the weakness in our applet system.  Another big reason for the move is that over time, the spices website has become bloated with old abandoned applets and themes that no longer work. This makes it much harder for people to find the good working ones, and reflects poorly on the applet developers, the spices website, and even Cinnamon itself. We could, of course, have taken the time to clean it all up, but if we just left the same system in place, it would have ended up in the same state all over again, but this time, it probably would happen even quicker.  On top of that, any time one of us wants to make a cool addition to Cinnamon, we've always had to weigh the risk of breaking api for existing applets against the value of the change we want to make. Sometimes we decide that it's not worth it, and the users miss out on the feature. Other times (vertical panels and removing the boxpointers were two recent examples) we decide the need or benefit outweighs the potential downsides of changing the api. In still other situations, we find a way to implement the feature, while still maintaining compatibility with older code by adding additional hacks and programmatic glue, but at the cost of code that is harder to read and maintain or that introduces unnecessary complexity (for example, switching over to the new xlet settings).  By moving everything to a central github repository, we solved all of that (or at least made it much easier to solve). We are no longer beholden to the api, because we can more easily be in communication with applet devs about upcoming changes in the api so you can adapt to it before the new version is even released, and even make the necessary changes ourselves if need be (such as for abandoned applets).",COMMENT

Just open office document &amp; try to write something while notification covering the pointer of typing then you will encounter it ! If you did or do this &amp; really not encounter this bug, then all what I could say is that I'm on Fedora 24 x64 bit Cinnamon version. I think that you tried on Linux Mint, wasn't it? Please try it on Fedora ......  2) Yes, it will be fixed (or in fact it will be just workaround not real fix) if you add ability to disable notification. Adding this will be good workaround till you find real fix for this issue.     Please make new option under name of &quot;Disable notification&quot; not &quot;Hide&quot;, because in original GNOME version there is &quot;Hide&quot; option which mean different thing: it mean when CapsLock/NumLuck is inactive by use then corresponding icon in panel will disappear completely &amp; if key is activated then corresponding icon will appear brisky in penal.

This would allow it to survive a reboot, though even then, there is a good chance that there wont be anything there. Freezes often don't leave any errors, as they are often caused by valid code with faulty logic. (The increased cpu usage suggests that might indeed be the case here).

If I try to place the applet into a vertical panel, I get the normal popup informing me that the applet isn't suitable for vertical panels and the system freeze.  This is the content of **.xsession-errors** at the exact time of the freeze.  ``` (nemo:4196): GVFS-RemoteVolumeMonitor-WARNING **: Owner of volume monitor org.gtk.vfs.UDisks2VolumeMonitor disconnected from the bus; removing drives/volumes/mounts  (nemo:4196): GVFS-RemoteVolumeMonitor-WARNING **: Owner of volume monitor org.gtk.vfs.AfcVolumeMonitor disconnected from the bus; removing drives/volumes/mounts  (nemo:4196): GVFS-RemoteVolumeMonitor-WARNING **: Owner of volume monitor org.gtk.vfs.GoaVolumeMonitor disconnected from the bus; removing drives/volumes/mounts  (nemo:4196): GVFS-RemoteVolumeMonitor-WARNING **: Owner of volume monitor org.gtk.vfs.MTPVolumeMonitor disconnected from the bus; removing drives/volumes/mounts  (nemo:4196): GVFS-RemoteVolumeMonitor-WARNING **: Owner of volume monitor org.gtk.vfs.GPhoto2VolumeMonitor disconnected from the bus; removing drives/volumes/mounts  ** (cinnamon-settings-daemon:4101): WARNING **: Name taken or bus went away - shutting down  ** (cinnamon-settings-daemon:4101): WARNING **: Name taken or bus went away - shutting down Terminated ```  Placing the applet into an horizontal panel works normally **but**, when I try to remove it from the horizontal panel, the system freeze with a similar error logged into **.xsession-errors**.  ``` cinnamon-session[4662]: Gdk-WARNING: t+478,68021s: cinnamon-session: Fatal IO error 11 (Resource not available temporarily) on X server :1.   ** (cinnamon-settings-daemon:4700): WARNING **: Name taken or bus went away - shutting down  ** (cinnamon-settings-daemon:4700): WARNING **: Name taken or bus went away - shutting down  (cinnamon-settings-daemon:4700): Gdk-WARNING **: cinnamon-settings-daemon: Fatal IO error 11 (Resource not available temporarily) on X server :1. ```  All this is very strange, because removing the applet from the panel on Cinnamon 2.8 (Linux Mint 17.3) or Cinnamon 3.0.7 (Linux Mint 18) works perfectly without any freeze nor errors/warnings logged anywhere. And when I switched this applet to *multiversion* a couple of months ago, the applet worked fine also on Cinnamon 3.2.x.  Just in case it's useful, my Cinnamon 3.2.x system is in a VirtualBox machine. It used to be a LM18 system with [this PPA](https://github.com/linuxmint/Cinnamon/wiki/Trying-out-the-latest-Cinnamon-without-building-it.) and then I updated it to LM18.1 through the updates manager (still using the same PPA and up-to-date).  @DiWa51  You don't need to completely reboot your system nor to completely remove your applets folder. You just have to go to a TTY (&lt;kbd&gt;Ctrl&lt;/kbd&gt; + &lt;kbd&gt;Alt&lt;/kbd&gt; + &lt;kbd&gt;F1&lt;/kbd&gt;), log in and then rename the **~/.xsession-errors** and **~/.cinnamon/glass.log** files (so they aren't overwritten on next Cinnamon start) and then rename the applet's folder (so the system would not freeze on next Cinnamon start). When you finish, just use the `startx` command to start Cinnamon. Remember to remove the applet from the panel after starting Cinnamon and renaming back the applet's folder. ",COMMENT

Under Theme Settings in the applet's Preferences, you can either disable &quot;Show active app indicators&quot;, or try &quot;Use the panel launcher class for pinned apps&quot;. Depending on the theme, these options work. You can change the pseudo class for app buttons as well.

With &quot;show active app indicators&quot; disabled and also the &quot;Number display&quot; set to &quot;normal&quot; (so a number is always shown for running apps), I can now tell the following:  1. Active application: hilighted by theme (in case of Arc / Mint-Y it is underlined with the hilight color) 2. Running (non-active) application: will have a number but is not underlined. 3. Non-running pinned application: is in the &quot;taskbar&quot;, but no number, no underlining.  So that is basically what I felt was necessary and it does work well as you indicate.  Thanks again for the quick reply.  @clefebvre thanks for pointing this issue to @jaszhix : one thing I am confused about with the new consolidated github project for all the applets is how to find out who the author is?  So is there possibly a &quot;README.md&quot; that each applet should have to show this?  Or?  I tried digging around and I still can't determine that jaszhix is the author even though I know it is him :-)  Good work btw consolidating the applets, I think it will help in the long term.
