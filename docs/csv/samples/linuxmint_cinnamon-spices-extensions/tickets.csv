An answer was: &gt; Writing a review that actually gives an approval requires Write access to the repository, so it's unlikely that we'll change the behaviour of code owners to request a review from anybody with less than Write access. I have recorded your feedback for the team to review though.  I've answered: &gt; I know it's possible in repos settings to protect branches, so you need code owners approval. But it's not a requirement for the codeowners review request. In fact (as a user) you can go to any unrelated/random repo and add a review. Example: https://github.com/lecoursen/renamed/pull/2#pullrequestreview-55277316 I just approved a PR with no write access whatsoever. I'm not saying you should allow any random user to be codeowner, but somehow to provide a way, to be a user codeowner without the user need to have write access to the repo, e.g. when the user stars the repo (or something else)  Response was: &gt; I'd be happy to pass that additional context along to the team to consider.

The first line in your readme has html tags. Both Github and the spices website are expecting markdown instead. I'm not sure what will happen with that, but I don't expect it to look very good. 2. Line 19 of extension.js uses a synchronous call. In this case it probably isn't a huge issue, but it's always preferable to use synchronous calls where possible. 3. metadata.json contains the dangerous property, which should not be included here. It is automatically added by Cinnamon when you open the settings window, and it's purpose is to help users identify potential causes of freezes, etc. If you leave out that line, the extension settings will flag your extension as potentially dangerous because of the synchronous call mentioned above. 4. prefs.json could be eliminated by moving the entire object to extension.js and storing it as a global variable near the top of your file. This would have the added benefit of removing the need for the synchronous call mentioned in points 2 and 3. 5. settings-schema.json uses 'header' items which are deprecated. You should use 'section' instead. This was a change that was made for Cinnamon 3.2 and the online docs have not yet been updated to reflect that change. 6. Your commit message should contain the name or uuid of the extension (like you did in the pr title) so that we can keep the commit history clean and easy to read.",COMMENT

The prefs file is going to be overwritten by an update, but using the settings api will make it persistent across upgrades (unless you change the key name). You can store any data type in a generic setting type, including objects. For example, you could do something like this in settings-schema.json:          &quot;prefs&quot;: {             &quot;type&quot;: &quot;generic&quot;,             &quot;default&quot;: {                 &quot;windows_10&quot;: {                     &quot;focused&quot;: {                         &quot;normal&quot;:        [3, -1, 0, 3, 128],                         &quot;dialog&quot;:        [3, -1, 0, 3, 128],                         &quot;modal_dialog&quot;:  [3, -1, 0, 1, 128],                         &quot;utility&quot;:       [3, -1, 0, 3, 128],                         &quot;border&quot;:        [3, -1, 0, 3, 128],                         &quot;menu&quot;:          [3, -1, 0, 3, 128],                         &quot;popup-menu&quot;:    [1,  0, 0, 1, 128],                         &quot;dropdown-menu&quot;: [1, 10, 0, 1, 128],                         &quot;attached&quot;:      [1,  0, 0, 1, 128]                     },                         &quot;unfocused&quot;: {                         &quot;normal&quot;:        [3, -1, 0, 3, 128],                         &quot;dialog&quot;:        [3, -1, 0, 3, 128],                         &quot;modal_dialog&quot;:  [3, -1, 0, 1, 128],                         &quot;utility&quot;:       [3, -1, 0, 3, 128],                         &quot;border&quot;:        [3, -1, 0, 3, 128],                         &quot;menu&quot;:          [3, -1, 0, 3, 128],                         &quot;popup-menu&quot;:    [1,  0, 0, 1, 128],                         &quot;dropdown-menu&quot;: [1, 10, 0, 1, 128],                         &quot;attached&quot;:      [1,  0, 0, 1, 128]                     }                 },                 &quot;no_shadows&quot;: {                     &quot;focused&quot;: {                         &quot;normal&quot;:        [1, -1, 0, 3, 0],                         &quot;dialog&quot;:        [1, -1, 0, 3, 0],                         &quot;modal_dialog&quot;:  [1, -1, 0, 1, 0],                         &quot;utility&quot;:       [1, -1, 0, 1, 0],                         &quot;border&quot;:        [1, -1, 0, 3, 0],                         &quot;menu&quot;:          [1, -1, 0, 3, 0],                         &quot;popup-menu&quot;:    [1, -1, 0, 1, 0],                         &quot;dropdown-menu&quot;: [1, 10, 0, 1, 0],                         &quot;attached&quot;:      [1, -1, 0, 1, 0]                     },                     &quot;unfocused&quot;: {                         &quot;normal&quot;:        [1, -1, 0, 3, 0],                         &quot;dialog&quot;:        [1, -1, 0, 3, 0],                         &quot;modal_dialog&quot;:  [1, -1, 0, 3, 0],                         &quot;utility&quot;:       [1, -1, 0, 1, 0],                         &quot;border&quot;:        [1, -1, 0, 3, 0],                         &quot;menu&quot;:          [1, -1, 0, 0, 0],                         &quot;popup-menu&quot;:    [1, -1, 0, 1, 0],                         &quot;dropdown-menu&quot;: [1, 10, 0, 1, 0],                         &quot;attached&quot;:      [1, -1, 0, 3, 0]                     }                 },                 &quot;default&quot;: {                     &quot;focused&quot;: {                         &quot;normal&quot;:        [6, -1, 0, 3, 255],                         &quot;dialog&quot;:        [6, -1, 0, 3, 255],                         &quot;modal_dialog&quot;:  [6, -1, 0, 1, 255],                         &quot;utility&quot;:       [3, -1, 0, 1, 255],                         &quot;border&quot;:        [6, -1, 0, 3, 255],                         &quot;menu&quot;:          [6, -1, 0, 3, 255],                         &quot;popup-menu&quot;:    [1, -1, 0, 1, 128],                         &quot;dropdown-menu&quot;: [1, 10, 0, 1, 128],                         &quot;attached&quot;:      [6, -1, 0, 1, 255]                     },                     &quot;unfocused&quot;: {                         &quot;normal&quot;:        [3, -1, 0, 3, 128],                         &quot;dialog&quot;:        [3, -1, 0, 3, 128],                         &quot;modal_dialog&quot;:  [3, -1, 0, 3, 128],                         &quot;utility&quot;:       [3, -1, 0, 1, 128],                         &quot;border&quot;:        [3, -1, 0, 3, 128],                         &quot;menu&quot;:          [3, -1, 0, 0, 128],                         &quot;popup-menu&quot;:    [1, -1, 0, 1, 128],                         &quot;dropdown-menu&quot;: [1, 10, 0, 1, 128],                         &quot;attached&quot;:      [3, -1, 0, 3, 128]                     }                 }             }         }  Say you bind the setting to the variable &quot;prefs&quot; in extension.js, you could do something like      this.prefs.no_shadows.focused.normal = [1, -1, 0, 1, 0];     this.prefs.save(); From there you could build a tool for adding new entries so the user doesn't have to edit a hard-to-find text file that will break if the syntax isn't just right (I submitted a PR to Cinnamon that introduces editable lists to the settings api, which would be useful for this purpose but unfortunately it wont be available for 3.2). Also, you can use the settings.set_options(key, options) method to change the available options for the combo box.  &gt;  If it would remove retro-compatibility, I think, we shouldn't fix this. In fact, I'll replace buttons with something else, if it restore their functionality in the older versions.  Button type is fine, it's the header type that is deprecated. It still works for now, though, so it's not a huge problem if you don't want to fix it atm.  P.S. Welcome to Cinnamon spices development. Your extension seems to work well, and I might end up keeping it installed.",COMMENT

Although, it has some errors that need to be corrected (logged into the glass.log file).  As for the gnome2alttab@savagetiger.org extension, it tries to import a module that doesn't exists, so it doesn't work. ",COMMENT

However, win7alttab ignores my window preview settings, that is it shows the selected app in background and the others transparent, but maybe that is also part of the extension.
