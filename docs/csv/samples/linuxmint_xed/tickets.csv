I believe the Mint maintainers ran some automated C reformatting scripts to clean up and re-structure the old gedit code when they forked Xed, but that's also wiped out a lot of (potentially) useful hints. That said (and having worked with decades old, incorrectly and outdated commented X11 and Gnome code), it may equally have been a good decision to lose the comments.  I'm just wishing for someone more intimate with the gedit/xed code to sprinkle a few comments here and there to get things started (and become more inviting to tinkering).

However, I would prefer a shortcut where the selected text is hard re-wrapped according to the preference *Editor &gt; Display &gt; Right margin at column* `NNN`. If nothing is selected then the current paragraph should be re-wrapped. The re-wrapping works just like the console program `fmt -w NNN`.  &lt;sub&gt;I thought there was a plug-in which allowed you to send the selected text to custom shell scripts, but I cannot find it anymore. With this plug-in I could create at least the basic functionality of the desired shortcut myself.&lt;/sub&gt;  Why I prefer the shortcut over automatic wrapping: - Wrapping (parts of) an unwrapped file is easier. With automatic wrapping you have to type something in every line, delete that something, go to the next line and repeat. For re-wrapping short lines you also have to delete line breaks manually. - I often edit the same paragraph over and over. I think the continuous automatic wrapping would annoy me when editing. Wrapping the final version using the shortcut seems more pleasing to me.  Of course the best solution would be to have both: A shortcut for on-demand wrapping and a setting for automatic wrapping while typing.  -------  A big thank you to the authors for making xed!

All line breaks, other than the one forcibly and invisibly added at the end, are editable in gedit/xed. And certainly not 'most' text editors add this extra line break. None of the text editors I've used on Windows do this (Notepad, Notepad++, PNotepad), and even on Linux not all do this either, in fact I used some of these to remove these line-breaks. None of the major IDE's do this either (MS Visual Studio, Netbeans, etc). It is not 'normal' behavior at all.  It is ridiculous to suggest one has to resort to hex editing to remove this line-break, every time one saves a text file. There aren't even any good hex editors for Linux (wxHexEditor is reasonable though, I personally use HexWorkshop running under Wine).  If an 'expert' user is so inclined to require the ending line-break in his files, he can trivially add this himself: it is just one freaking keystroke!! But as long as the line-break is forced on the user, one has to resort to far more time consuming efforts to remove it (hex editing, installing a second text editor). The solution IMO is plain as day: disable this default behavior, perhaps add a preferences option, or simply leave it to user to hit the 'enter key' to manually add the line-break.  I've written a few text editors and complex text parsers myself, and it is absolutely trivial to handle EOF cases. I would not trust any tools that struggle with this. And as dodona2 commented, it appears the issue with 'cat' has been fixed by now anyway, so this lame workaround is no longer needed.  This issue should still be regarded as a bug; it is undocumented behavior, non-intuitive, invisible to the user, non-optional, and can unnoticeably corrupt user data. You just have to google for the tons of issues that users have due to this 'feature'; most of them have no idea their files even have ending line-breaks, because it is intentionally hidden from them. It personally took me weeks to find out that I could not trust gedit to display all characters stored in the file, I was looking for bugs in my own and other software that didn't exist.

A line not ending in a newline is not considered a line at all!  It is also part of the ANSI C 1989 standard (section 2.1.1.2) and ISO C 1999 (section 5.1.1.2).   I wasn't suggesting using a hex editor to remove the newline. I was suggesting to use them on binary files, those being the only files where a trailing newline is undesirable.  The matter is not as simple as &quot;one freaking keystroke&quot;. You will tend to forget it, often leaving broken text files in your wake.

Binary files definitely aren't the only files in which trailing line-breaks aren't needed, in our cross platform project we have thousands of plain text files without them (typically originating from Windows users), and editing by some Linux (Xed/gedit) users adds the new-line, causing confusion with version control.  I concur that it is easy to forget adding the new-line, so a warning would be useful. Making the feature optional IMO is best.

But I guess this begins to expose the inadequacy of the choices of the POSIX standard a bit now...  There's absolutely no distinction between the random line-break anywhere in the file and the last one forced on us. Therefor, the editor should show one empty line at the bottom of the text, same as the others, but which one cannot delete. I have used some editors on windows in the past that did this (I think MSVC5 or VB4/5), it felt 'wrong' as UI behavior (especially because the new-line *wasn't* written to file) but could actually be a reasonable, intuitive solution for this case.  Even better, if the forced line-break is displayed visibly (with this symbol: &crarr;), it is absolutely clear to the user whether the behavior is enabled, and why there's a trailing line-break added to the file.

If I were to open the file in, say, vim, it would not display confusing ^M characters that don't mean anything -- it would continue to display simply a series of lines of readable text (possibly prose sentences), but the footer, right next to the name of the file, would display the status message: `[dos]` indicating that the file is formatted using a line ending mode which is not native to my operating system.  &gt; Only mcedit shows correctly the lines &gt; Geany adds LF but doesn't register them.  None of that is what I'd truly call &quot;correct&quot;. If you want your text editor to display symbols, then the non-printable (formatting-only!) ASCII bytes `0x0D` `0x0A` must somehow be printed to the screen anyway. In which case, my expectation is that the formatting characteristic of &quot;beginning a new line&quot; shall not be rendered -- show me an unbroken stream of rendered bytes.  &gt; In Geany, the cursor is positioned where new typing will go. So, we know what we do. It's not the case with Pluma/xed. With mcedit, it's impossible to add CR.  In xed or pluma or vim or Notepad++ or any other text editor, the cursor is positioned where new typing will go. By default that is the beginning of the first line of the file, but if I move the cursor to the end of the last line, I can append to the end of the last line. If I move the cursor to the end of the last line, then type the ENTER key, future typing will be appended to a new line (which did not exist in the file when I opened the file).  I still do not understand why any of this is a problem. But then, neither do I understand why you are anxious to add ASCII byte `0x0D` (also known as the C escape sequence `\r` or the control character &quot;carriage return&quot;) to a file.  - xed is not a hex editor, you're not supposed to use it to type ASCII control codes. Is there a use case for doing so either when editing prose, or when editing source code? - What does the presence or absence of non-printable control characters denoted by their caret notation, have to do with whether or not xed should treat prose files ending in an LF-terminated, non-empty line, as though they had an additional LF-terminated, empty line? - Under what circumstances should a prose file refrain from adding the expected end-of-line LF character to files which don't end with one? - Under what circumstances should a source code file refrain from adding the end-of-line LF character to files which don't end with one, keeping in mind that some source code file formats consider its absence to be a non-recoverable error, and I cannot think of any case where the end-of-line LF character is explicitly considered to be incorrect?",COMMENT

Sorry, but that is factually incorrect:  CR = Carriage Return means effectively 'end of line', or more correctly, return to beginning of the (same!) line. See also: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carriage_return  LF = Line Feed, literally means 'end of current line AND start of new line'. If no characters follow, it is by definition an empty line. Xed does _not_ show this, but _does_ write it to the file when saved. It even adds it to unchanged files when saved.

When the user is in control of his/her computer. Xed takes control away from the user by adding unwanted hidden linebreaks, and 'lies' about it, by hiding it in the application. I've never seen a keyboard without an Enter key (most keyboards have two), and have never met a computer user who does not know how to use these keys. I mention this, because Unix and Linux is all about the user having total control.  &gt; some source code file formats consider its absence to be a non-recoverable error  Then that is a problem of that particular piece of software.

As long as you stick strictly to end-of-line terminators, without adding additional byte sequences consisting of a blank line, terminated by an LF, php won't try to print blank lines as part of your application before you're done printing the headers.  &gt; configuration files that may NOT end with linebreaks  WHAT. Examples???  &gt; single line configuration files that may not contain any linebreaks (e.g. password/hash/key)  I'm pretty sure every such file I've ever come across has either used linebreaks or not cared about them. I'm also pretty sure I've never seen any password system ever, which permits an LF as a character of the password itself, if only due to the fact that the &lt;ENTER&gt; key is used to submit the password, not add more bytes before submission.  Hashes are not permitted to contain newlines, since they are hex-encoded strings and thus the pool of permitted characters when representing a hash is `[a-fA-F0-9]`. base64 may contain `[0-9a-zA-Z+/]` and will ignore any LF characters, silently joining the lines before decoding.  A keyfile is usually treated as a binary file, for example you can use a png as a keyfile. I don't recommend editing binary files in xed for any reason.  &gt; version control (adding unnecessary changes to files)  Consistently using terminating LF in all your files ensures that version control correctly accounts for your files. git will produce messages indicating unnecessary changes, via the message &quot;No newline at end of file&quot;, indicating the missing LF is bad.  &gt; digital archiving (not secretly changing unchanged files)  Do not change digitally archived files for any reason. Open them in readonly mode, and do not click save.  &gt; Then that is a problem of that particular piece of software. Let's not add bugs to text editors to work around that problem. And as another user already commented in this thread, **_those issues were fixed decades ago_**.  The nonrecoverable error is &quot;this file does not match the POSIX definition of a line of text&quot;, but in fact most C compilers today do in fact include clumsy workarounds that complicate the parser, as a hack job in order to work around bugs in Windows text editors.  It is a generally problematic issue for any file format or workflow in which: - one file can be included into another file - multiple files can be concatenated together  and - the user has an expectation that his files will be faithfully represented as stored - line breaks change the meaning of the parser (anything other than C languages, and C languages also when the context is a preprocessor macro)  You may also try using `cat` on a file without a terminating LF on the last non-blank line.   &gt; Most word processors or code editors have a feature to show hidden characters (including linebreaks): https://i.stack.imgur.com/tPKls.png  Then consider showing your support for #225  &gt; Can we please conclude that people have different preferances and opinions on this, and that Xed needs, at least, a configurable option to disable this behavior?

After trying a number of different editors, they all defaulted to adding a new line, though some did have the option to disable it. Many of them don't show the extra line either, and some of them are inconsistent about it (Kate, for example, shows the extra line at first, allows you to delete it, and then adds the newline on save but doesn't show it until you reopen the file).  I think it's hard to argue that xed behaves 'incorrectly' since it doesn't do anything that isn't common among other editors. However, I do agree that there should be an option if possible so I tagged this as a feature request rather than a bug.  Please note that I'm not sure this is even something we control currently, and may be handled by the upstream libraries we rely on (looking through the code, I couldn't find any instance of where we add newline characters so my first guess is that it's added by some code in GtkSourceView or even Gtk itself). That doesn't mean we can't change the behavior, but it may pose additional challenges in implementing this option.",COMMENT

I've looked into the issue, and I hereby request you reopen this ticket as a feature request. I'll explain why below.  _In the past..._ GTK+ had Ubuntu overlay scrollbars. There were various ways to disable them, including `export LIBOVERLAY_SCROLLBAR=0`, apt removing various (lib)overlay-scrollbar* packages, via programs (gsettings, gconf-editor, gnome-tweaks, etc) and via various GUIs provided by window managers.  _Noaways..._ The toolkit itself no longer offers an overlay scrollbar setting, to prevent such a blanket toolkit toggle from breaking applications that haven't been tested with both combinations. The overlay nature of the scrollbars is now part of the toolkit. To allow application developers to decide what their applications should look like, the toolkit provides a mechanism to opt-out or add a setting for users.  The function [gtk_scrolled_window_set_overlay_scrolling()](https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/GtkScrolledWindow.html#gtk-scrolled-window-set-overlay-scrolling) can be used to enable/disable overlay scrolling. Application developers can optionally use [GSettings](https://blog.gtk.org/2017/05/01/first-steps-with-gsettings/) to have a user setting bound to the property.",COMMENT

I think this is an issue because my error is easy to make -- &quot;sudo xed&quot; gets more hits on Google than &quot;gksudo xed&quot; -- and leads to wide-ranging consequences whose cause is hard to identify.    (This tracker is an issue tracker, not a bug tracker.  I agree that xed doesn't have a bug, but I am nonetheless suggesting that it could deal better with this issue.  Arguably the design bug was in the original design of sudo, which had to be preserved for legacy reasons, with gksudo being the patched version.)  Mint aims to be easy to use for novice users.  So perhaps tools such as xed should pop up a warning when they are mistakenly run under sudo rather than gksudo.  My guess is that novice users are more likely to use xed as root than other MATE tools, because they have to edit config files.",COMMENT

It is weird that opening the searchbar then allows you tile. Ultimately whether or not you can tile is decided by the minimum width that the window wants in a certain direction. This can be affected by translations because they can change the length of strings and thus change that minimum requirement. Themes can also affect it because one may use different padding values in the widgets compared to another. In the end this isn't really a bug but just how it works. The only thing that seems strange is that opening the search bar changes it. It must change the size request of something in the window that then allows you to tile. I would imagine if you had a bit larger screen res you wouldn't see this at all. I don't on 1920x1080.,COMMENT

Doing some quick testing I don't see any real speed difference between using page up/down in Leafpad vs. xed. It might give that perception but the actual speed difference seems really minimal.,COMMENT

If you open system monitor with the file open and the syntax highlighting enabled you will notice it using large amounts of memory. I can reproduce the same issue in Gedit3.18.

A common lib would allow us to implement different frontends / UI while working together on the same core, thus allowing us to reuse the work done in GNOME, but without completely forking it. I won't go through the many benefits, as they're quite obvious for both sides.  (This isn't really a new fork (it's basically the DE-agnostic continuation of the Pluma fork) but the idea is the same).  I remember talking with Jasper about this. GNOME is obviously heading somewhere we don't want to go and many applications, after being patched more and more heavily, are now getting forked. Some of them are designed as implementation of their own core libs though, and that highlights some of the other reasons why forks are sometimes necessary.  If you look at the history of the Cinnamon project for instance, before it was given snapping, resizable tiling and all, the reason mutter was forked wasn't to create a different WM, but simply to keep the API stable. We couldn't work with Mutter, not because of what it was, but because of how it was developed. It changed drastically every 6 months, and its only scope was the new upcoming GNOME Shell. For Cinnamon to be shipped to various distributions, each running different versions of Mutter, it was a challenge to adapt to its lack of backward compatibility and to its many refactorings.  If I look at gtef here for instance, which definitely sounds like something we should consider migrating to, in theory at least, what immediately strikes me is that it depends on GTK 3.20. It's not a big deal and it's probably quite easy to make it compatible with previous GTK versions (we're committed all the way to 3.14 in terms of development targets), but it's very important for us, if we're going to use something and rely on it going forward, that the commitment is there on what matters to us. It cannot change, or break, or lose compatibility with our targets.. if it did, because we'd have to support both new and old versions we'd start having more and more ifdefs in the code, and juggling with hacks, until eventually it would become simpler to drop the dependency. It means discipline and commitment would be required upstream. All desktop environments would need to be supported and included in the scope, redesigns/refactoring wouldn't be allowed to break existing apps etc etc..   It's a case by case story and nobody has the right to demand that level of commitment or to misinterpret  the scope of a particular GNOME project. It is important though, if we work together on shared code, that that code does what we need it to and for the long run and that its scope is defined and includes all the projects relying on it.  I wouldn't say it's easy to come up with something like gtef, and I really appreciate the effort. That's the technical side though, the code as a shareable resource. It's good but it's not enough. The scope and goal of the project have to be defined, the framework needs to reach maturity (I assume it's already quite stable... but by maturity I mean its design has to be stable, to guarantee upcoming changes/refactors will be as small as possible and won't impact applications using it), backward compatibility is key.  The code matters. As you say it was 40k lines of code over there in Pluma which weren't in gedit all these years. It's not even really duplicating efforts... efforts are being made on both sides and don't benefit everybody. So it's a pity. Here with Xed, we essentially have &quot;yet another fork&quot;, it's not really the same story repeating itself... and although the code is indeed forked and duplicated, we're actually focusing effort here with this rather than spreading it.  What really matters to me, much more than the code, are the ideas and the people involved. I'm sure gtef could work for instance, but what's interesting isn't gtef itself, its code and the code removal it would mean in Xed/Pluma/gedit. What's much more interesting is you, me, the MATE team, the GNOME team working together. Before we talk about design and code and framework, we need to talk about goals, commitment, and have everybody understand what matters to everybody else. After that we can hopefully find common grounds and benefit from each other's work. ",COMMENT

For the dependency on GTK+ 3.20, it's how most GNOME software is developed. With each new version of GTK+, there is usually a few things to adapt, e.g. not using deprecated APIs. If that maintenance work is done regularly, every 6 months, when GTK+ 4 will be released it'll be much easier to port the code, since the first steps are already done. And I prefer to not clutter my code with ifdefs that checks various versions of GTK+.  Anyway, I hope that Gtef will become one day feature-full enough to develop easily a new text editor. And I hope that gedit will be ported to Gtef (it's complicated because of the plugins API, ideally the plugins should not break). And if the remaining code in the gedit core is quite small, then it'll be much easier to create (and maintain in the long term) a fork that has a traditional UI. And if one day that happens, you'll be able to use an older version that has old enough dependencies (but I guess that systems like [Flatpak](https://blogs.gnome.org/mclasen/2016/06/07/modularity-and-the-desktop/) will be the preferred way to develop and use an application).
