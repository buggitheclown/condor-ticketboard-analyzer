I tried this before including restarting Cinnamon, but I think I didn't close the extension window. So the whole workaround is this: 1. Deinstall extension (e.g. Flipper), just quit or remove doesn't work (minus sign is deactivated). 2. Install extension again, but don't activate it yet. 3. Add actual Cinnamon version (4.0) to metadata.json (that wasn't necessary before) 4. Close and reopen extension/settings window (and restart Cinnamon?) 5. Activate extension  Should I close this issue? For me it's closed, but for others...?",COMMENT
